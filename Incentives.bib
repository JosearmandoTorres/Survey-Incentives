  abstract = {Background Surveys are an effective method for collecting a large quantity of data. However, incomplete responses to these surveys can affect the validity of the studies and introduce bias. Recent studies have suggested that monetary incentives may increase survey response rates. We intended to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the effect of monetary incentives on survey participation. Methods A systematic search of electronic databases was conducted to collect studies assessing the impact of monetary incentives on survey participation. The primary outcome of interest was the response rates to incentives: money, lottery, and voucher. We used the Cochrane Collaboration tool to assess the risk of bias in randomized trials. We calculated the rate ratio (RR) with its 95\% confidence interval (95\% CI) using Review Manager Software (version 5.3). We used random-effects analysis and considered the data statistically significant with a P-value {$<$}0.05. Results Forty-six RCTs were included. A total of 109,648 participants from 14 countries were involved. The mean age of participants ranged from 15 to more than 60 years, with 27.5\% being males, 16.7\% being females, and the other 55.8\% not reported. Our analysis showed a significant increase in response rate in the incentive group compared to the control group, irrespective of the incentive methods. Money was the most efficient way to increase the response rate (RR: 1.25; 95\% CI: 1.16,1.35; P = {$<$} 0.00001) compared to voucher (RR: 1.19; 95\% CI: 1.08,1.31; P = {$<$} 0.0005) and lottery (RR: 1.12; 95\% CI: 1.03,1.22; P = {$<$} 0.009). Conclusion Monetary incentives encourage the response rate in surveys. Money was more effective than vouchers or lotteries. Therefore, researchers may include money as an incentive to improve the response rate while conducting surveys.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Physicians are a commonly targeted group in health research surveys, but their response rates are often relatively low. The goal of this paper was to evaluate the effect of unconditional incentives in the form of a coffee card on physician postal survey response rates. DESIGN: Following 13 key informant interviews and eight cognitive interviews a survey questionnaire was developed. PARTICIPANTS: A random sample of 534 physicians, stratified by physician group (geriatricians, family physicians, emergency physicians) was selected from a national medical directory. SETTING: Using computer generated random numbers; half of the physicians in each stratum were allocated to receive a coffee card to a popular national coffee chain together with the first survey mailout. INTERVENTIONS: The intervention was a \$10 Tim Hortons gift card given to half of the physicians who were randomly allocated to receive the incentive. RESULTS: 265 (57.0\%) physicians completed the survey. The response rate was significantly higher in the group allocated to receive the incentive (62.7\% vs 51.3\% in the control group; p=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that an unconditional incentive in the form of a coffee gift card can substantially improve physician response rates. Future research can look at the effect of varying amounts of cash on the gift cards on response rates.},

To contribute to the broader goal of minimizing survey nonresponse, this study considers several factors that can impact survey nonresponse, using a 2007 Animal Welfare Survey Conducted in Ohio, USA. In particular, the paper examines the extent to which topic salience and incentives affect survey participation and item nonresponse, drawing on the leverage-saliency theory (Groves, Singer and Corning 2000). We find that participation in a survey is affected by its subject context (as this exerts either positive or negative leverage on sampled units) and prepaid incentives, which is consistent with the leverage-saliency theory. Our expectations are also confirmed by the finding that item nonresponse, our proxy for response quality, does vary by proximity to agriculture and the environment (residential location, knowledge about how food is grown, and views about the importance of animal welfare). However, the data suggests that item nonresponse does not vary according to whether or not a respondent received incentives.},

The objective of this study was to assess the impact of a monetary incentive intended for administrative assistants on the survey response rate of physicians in leadership positions. METHODS: This was an ancillary study to a national survey of chairs of academic Departments of Medicine in the United States about measuring faculty productivity. We randomized survey participants to receive or not receive a \$5 gift card enclosed in the survey package. The cover letter explained that the gift card was intended for the administrative assistants as a "thank you for their time." We compared the response rates between the 2 study arms using the Chi-square test. RESULTS: Out of 152 participants to whom survey packages were mailed to, a total of 78 responses were received (51~\% response rate). The response rates were 59~\% in the incentive arm and 46~\% in the no incentive arm. The relative effect of the incentive compared to no monetary incentive was borderline statistically significant (relative risk (RR)\,=\,1.36, 95~\% confidence interval (CI) 0.99 to 1.87; p\,=\,0.055). CONCLUSION: Monetary incentives intended for administrative assistants likely increase the response rate of physicians in leadership positions.},

  abstract = {To date there has been only a handful of studies on response rates of industrial mail surveys in the international setting. These studies have essentially dealt with either source of mailing effects or monetary incentives, and not a single study has dealt with both issues. Further, the results have been equivocal. In an attempt to resolve these equivocal findings, the authors report the results of a study wherein the impact of source of mailing effects and two types of monetary incentives on industrial mail survey response rates were investigated. Specifically, the hypotheses that a monetary incentive is better than a mailing effects incentive, a prize giveaway is better than a dollar incentive, and joint effects is better than only domestic mailing effects in enhancing response rates, were tested. Six hundred randomly selected Indian companies were systematically assigned to one of four groups, with a mailing size of 150 for each group. The four groups were the dollar incentive group, the prize giveaway group, the joint effects group, and a control group. The results indicate that the prize giveaway type of monetary incentive yielded a response rate of 25\% that was significantly higher than the 7\% of either the joint effects or the control group. Considering that prize giveaway had the least cost per response, it clearly appears superior to the other two tactics in enhancing response rates. More importantly, because joint effects fared no better than the control group in terms of response rates, it is difficult not to conclude that any attempt to sensitize respondents to a joint, domestic and foreign, affiliation in the context of research sponsorship would likely be a wasted effort.},

One thousand US primary care physicians were assigned randomly to receive a survey with either a \$5 bill or a \$2 bill as an incentive. For each of the two incentive groups, the overall response rate for three mailing waves, the total cost, and the total cost per usable response were measured. Results. The response rate among those receiving the \$5 bill (61\%) was 32\% higher than the response rate among those receiving the \$2 bill (46\%); overall costs were slightly higher in the \$5 group, but the cost per response for each group was similar (\$15.46 versus \$14.93). For the same cost, a higher response rate could have been achieved in the \$2 group if costs saved from foregoing the third mailing were instead used to increase the incentive for a portion of the subjects. Conclusions. A \$5 bill incentive yielded a higher response rate among the physicians in this study than did a \$2 bill incentive. Moreover, the powerful effect of the incentive size, combined with the consequent decline in the costs of subsequent mailing waves, suggests that resources in a fixed survey budget are allocated more efficiently to increasing the initial incentive rather than to providing a third wave to nonresponders.},

A metaanalysis of an online method of survey administration was used because the use of online surveys has greatly increased, making web-based survey administration an important form of data collection in multiple fields of research. Out of 12 located experimental published studies, nine studies met the selection criteria. Log-odds ratio (OR) was chosen as the main effect size estimator.

(2) Does the addition of non-monetary incentives to between-wave campaigns further impact response rates? (3) Do between-wave campaigns also affect other members of the household? Following a one-year break between survey waves, we design a randomized survey experiment assigning respondents to five treatment conditions.

We show that individuals in incentive-receiving households have a 1.3-percentage-point lower earnings non-response rate than those in non-incentive households. This effect is robust to controls for observed and unobserved individual heterogeneity and non-random panel attrition in a correlated random effects specification. Further, we find the effect is driven by a \$40 incentive assignment and not the \$20 incentive. Consistent with theories linking unit and item non-response, we find that contemporaneous earnings non-response is associated with a higher probability of attrition in the following wave, but the \$40 incentive mitigates this relationship.},

We test whether this is problematic using a large survey experiment on health and subjective well-being. We use Prelec’s Bayesian truth serum to incentivize the experiment and defaults to introduce biases in responses. Without defaults, the data quality was good and incentives had no impact. With defaults, incentives reduced default biases in the subjective well-being questions by inducing participants to spend more effort. Incentives had no impact on the health questions regardless of whether defaults were used.},

We investigate the relative effectiveness of reminder phone calls, pre-notification postcards, mailed paper surveys, and \$1 upfront incentives for boosting survey response rate by embedding a randomized experiment into a mixed-mode operational survey at the American Board of Internal Medicine in 2019. Expected response rates and average marginal effects for each follow-up method were computed from a logistic regression model. The control group which only received email reminders achieved a response rate of 18.2\%, 95\% CI: (15.0\%, 21.9\%). The intervention group which included reminder emails, pre-notification postcards, and mailed paper surveys with \$1 incentives achieved a response rate of 43.1\%, 95\% CI: (38.8\%, 47.5\%). Mailed paper surveys yielded the largest percentage point increase in response rate of 11.2\%, 95\% CI: (7.3\%, 15.2\%), while \$1 upfront monetary incentives and phone call reminders increased survey response rate by 5.9\%, 95\% CI: (1.6\%, 10.2\%) and 5.5\%, 95\% CI: (2.6\%, 8.3\%) respectively. Pre-notification postcards are associated with a 2.0\%, 95\% CI: (-1.7\%, 5.6\%) increase in survey response rate. Cost-effectiveness for each method is discussed.

We find that an incentive improves response rates primarily amongst those individuals with the longest history of income support receipt. Importantly, these individuals are least likely to respond to the survey in the absence of an incentive. The incentive thus improves both average response rates and acts to equalize response rates across different socio-economic groups, potentially reducing non-response bias. Interestingly, the main channel through which the incentive appears to increase response rates is in improving the probability of making contact with individuals in the group with heavy exposure to the income support system.},

For the first mailing of this survey, each respondent was randomly assigned to the control or experimental group, which was offered participation in a lottery upon return of the questionnaire. Response rate was 41.2\% in the experimental group and 34.8\% in the control group, a 6.4\% difference (CI95\%: 0.6\%-12.6\%). The additional cost of the lottery was about Can\$500, giving an incremental cost of Can\$16 per questionnaire returned. In conclusion, a lottery resulted in a small but statistically significant increase in the response rate of physicians to a mail survey. This method may be a cost-effective option when applied to large surveys.},

  abstract = {The feasibility of collecting DNA through the mail from a cohort of current and former smokers was assessed. Also examined was whether monetary incentives would increase response rates. A random sample of 300 subjects, stratified by 20 U.S. communities, was selected to participate. The sampling frame included the 6,726 people who were in both the Community Intervention Trial for Smoking Cessation (COMMIT) between 1988 and 1993 and the follow-up study in 2001, and who consented to being contacted again. Subjects were further randomized within communities to incentive arms of US\$10, US\$2, or US\$0. A total of 110 usable samples were returned (37\%), and the US\$10 incentive arm had the highest response (43\%). Logistic regression revealed no significant predictors of sending a DNA sample, although in a larger study, similar-sized odds ratios would be statistically significant for subjects who received the US\$10 incentive and for those who were White, female, or college graduates or whose household incomes were more than US\$60,000 per year. The spectrophotometer-determined median DNA yield was 44.93 μg (range=4.00–425.86 μg). Assuming that 50 ng of DNA would be needed for polymerase chain reaction amplification to determine any given genotype, 80–8,517 runs would be attainable. Qualitative findings suggest several methodological improvements to boost response rates. Institutional review board requirements, which are standardized on the inpatient, clinical protocol model, stipulated that noninstitutionally based subjects needed a witness to initial and date every page as well as sign the consent form. This pilot study showed that this requirement could pose some challenges in population-based research.},

Prepaid monetary incentives are expected to elicit higher response rates, as predicted by social exchange and subjectively expected utility theory. This is true especially in a survey on the respondents’ delinquent behaviour, since prepaid incentives are likely to strengthen the respondents’ trust towards the researcher. For surveys in which money is promised once the questionnaire is returned, we expect the response rates to be lower. The empirical findings clearly support our assumptions, even if the social mechanisms of reciprocity which underlie response behaviour cannot be observed directly. Our analysis also shows that monetary incentives evoke neither desirability, nor sponsorship effects which would cause overreporting of delinquency. Finally, our results show no systematic variation regarding socio-structural characteristics and correlates of delinquent behaviour.},

Analyses are based on a survey experiment of students from randomly selected school classes of equal shares, which have participated in the third wave. Findings show that a monetary incentive has a direct and positive effect on the response rate in the fourth but not in the subsequent wave. However, the effect of the incentive is not persistent, since the effect weakens and fades away during the field phase and cannot be directly transferred to the second survey mode. As emphasized in the tailored design method (TDM), a monetary incentive can contribute to a shorter field phase and hence lower costs, but it is an insufficient instrument against panel attrition and the optimization of the retention rate when other strategies are disregarded.},

The survey experiment involved an alternative procedure to analyse the effect of different types of prepaid incentives, taking selective attrition into account as well as considering problems related to causal inference. The subjects were students, from randomly-selected school classes, who had finished their compulsory school in 2013. The findings are clear: cash provides the strongest direct, positive effect on the overall response rate and also on the latency until response after first contact. The other incentives did not work as efficiently as did cash. Additionally, cash is the most likely to minimise social selectivity in response. Finally, cash provides the potential to convert refusals in previous waves into cooperation.},

In the context of a multiple-wave panel, Swiss juveniles who received cash are interviewed in an online survey on their preference for reciprocity. This information is used in the next panel wave a year later to reveal the effect of the panelists’ reciprocal preferences on their propensity to start completing an online questionnaire. Applying longitudinal paradata of the fieldwork period and the statistical procedures of event history analysis, it is found that panelists who provide preferences for strong reciprocity are more likely to take part at the survey immediately after the invitation. It is also found that the likelihood to reciprocate declines the greater the time since the gratuities are given and the invitation to participate in the survey is delivered. Numerous reminders do not help to refresh the invitees’ reciprocal preferences. In sum, prepaid monetary incentives are necessary but not sufficient for enhancing response rates: they are one of several strategies for inducing target persons’ participation in surveys.},

Research Design:~           Sampling was conducted in 2 stages. The first stage consisted of a simple random sample (SRS) of Medicaid enrollees. In the second stage, American Indian, African American, Latino, Hmong, and Somali enrollees were randomly sampled. A total of 8412 enrollees were assigned randomly to receive a mail survey with no incentive or a \$2.00 bill.           Results:~           The response rate within the SRS after the mail portion was 54\% in the incentive group and 45\% in the nonincentive group. Response rates increased considerably with telephone follow-ups. The incentive SRS response rate increased to 69\%, and the nonincentive response rate increased to 64\%. Differences between incentive conditions are more pronounced after the first mailing (P {$<$} 0.01); almost all differences remained significant (P {$<$} 0.05) after the completion of the mail mode. The inclusion of the \$2.00 incentive had similar effects on response rates and cost across the different racial and ethnic strata, except for Latino enrollees.           Conclusions:~           A mixed-mode mail and telephone methodology is effective for increasing response rates in a Medicaid population overall and within different racial and ethnic groupings. The effectiveness of this strategy can be enhanced, in terms of response rate and cost, by including a \$2.00 prepaid incentive.},

Customers, in turn, are expected to (i) fill in customer feedback surveys (participation) and (ii) provide accurate responses (performance). To encourage active participation and ensure accurate responses, companies traditionally offer either self-benefiting incentives, like lottery prizes, or prosocial incentives, like charity donations. More recently, some companies have started offering prosocial incentives on top of self-benefiting incentives in the hope to “sweeten the deal,” that is, to improve participation and performance even further. With this research, we challenge whether the on-top prosocial incentives are effective. The evidence from two field experiments and one incentive-aligned online experiment does not confirm any such advantage. In contrast, performance can decrease when a low-amount on-top prosocial incentive is offered relative to a pure self-benefiting setting. This trend is only reversed once the on-top incentive amount increases. Furthermore, for participation, we find that on-top prosocial incentives are ineffective and, at higher amounts, even detrimental. Therefore, our empirical insights rather suggest that on-top prosocial incentives “poison the well.”},

Study Design and Setting A two-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) embedded within the screening of older women for prevention of fracture trial (SCOOP). Women, aged 70–75~years, were randomized to receive a pen with their questionnaire (n~=~3,826) or to receive the questionnaire alone (n~=~3,829). The results were combined with another embedded RCT in a meta-analysis. Results A response rate of 92.4\% was observed in the pen group compared with 91.3\% in the control group (odds ratio [OR]~=~1.16; 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 0.98, 1.37; P~=~0.08). There was a difference in reminders required (OR~=~0.88; 95\% CI: 0.79, 0.98; P~=~0.02), time to response (hazard ratio~=~1.06; 95\% CI: 1.01, 1.11; P~=~0.01) and some difference in the completeness of response to the POQ (OR~=~1.18; 95\% CI: 1.00, 1.39; P~=~0.05). The pooled OR from the meta-analysis for response rate was 1.21 (95\% CI: 1.05, 1.39; P~=~0.01). Conclusion Inclusion of a pen with postal questionnaires potentially has a positive impact on response rates and the number of reminders required. There may be some reduction in time to response. Studies of different participant groups are needed to test the effectiveness over more diverse populations.},

  abstract = {This study evaluates the usefulness of both prepaid and promised monetary incentives in obtaining cooperation on a self-administered questionnaire. The experiment was conducted among respondents participating in a longitudinal study consisting of both face-to-face and telephone interviews. Three treatments were examined. One treatment group received a check for five U.S. dollars with the questionnaire along with instructions. A second group was told they would receive the five dollar payment when the questionnaire was completed. No mention of payment was made to the third group. The results indicate that a prepaid incentive may increase survey response rates but a promised incentive does not. Respondents in the prepaid category were more likely to return the questionnaire without follow-up calls. The prepaid incentive also resulted in a lower rate of item nonresponse. These findings suggest that the prepaid incentive may result in higher response rates and lower item nonresponse with only a moderate increase in cost.},

We mailed questionnaires to a random sample of veterinarians (n=683) from Texas with three types of incentives viz. \$1 bill (n=118), pen (n=111), \$1 bill with pen (n=114), and questionnaire only (n=340). A total of 303 (44\%; 95\% confidence interval, CI: 41–48) responses were received with the lowest response proportion of 37\% (95\% CI: 32–43) in the no incentive group and highest response proportion of 57\% (95\% CI: 47–66) in \$1 bill incentive group. Compared to no incentive, the response proportions were significantly higher (P{$<$}0.01) in groups receiving \$1 bill, \$1 bill with pen, and all incentives combined (\$1 bill, a pen or both). The addition of a pen only did not improve response proportion. These findings support the use of \$1 bill but not a pen alone as an effective incentive to increase response proportions to a postal questionnaire.},

We present the results from a 4\,×\,2 factorial experiment in which the first factor, the survey protocol, varied the modes initially offered (either web alone or both web and paper) as well as the order in which they are offered in subsequent follow-up contacts (either concurrently or sequentially). This factor was crossed with a second factor offering various promised incentive amounts and response options (a \$5 prepaid incentive with a promise of either \$10 or \$20 for response). Our research sought to evaluate the differences between protocols/incentive treatments relative to their costs, response rates, respondent choice of web versus paper response, and consistency with benchmark estimates in other large-scale surveys. Specifically, we introduce a new protocol referred to as choice+\,(i.e., choice plus) that presents both web and paper response options concurrently at the initial request, but promises a bonus (\$10) incentive for choosing the web option. Results presented are from the 2015 Residential Energy Consumption Survey National Pilot study—an experimental component of the main Residential Energy Consumption Survey sponsored by the U.S. Energy Information Administration.},

There was no evidence that either promised or prepaid incentives had a systematic effect on sample composition. The incentives helped to reduce fieldwork efforts. Thus, the costs of incentives can—at least partially—be offset by a reduction in the number of contact attempts required to achieve a certain number of completed interviews.

  abstract = {A major objective for longitudinal studies is retaining participants over time. The Millennium Cohort Study (MCS) is the largest on-going nationally representative study of young people in the UK (N = 18,818). Seven waves of data collection took place face-to-face between 2001 (age 9 months) and 2019 (age 17), with no monetary incentives offered. Throughout 2020 to 2021, participants were invited to take part in three web surveys focused on understanding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the third web survey, conditional monetary incentives were introduced in the form of a randomised experiment. Three quarters of the issued sample were offered a £10 voucher to complete the survey and the remaining proportion were offered no incentive as usual. Regression analyses were conducted to examine the effect of the incentive on response rates and various aspects of data quality. The incentive boosted the response rate by 7 percentage points, from a baseline of 24\%, with a stronger effect observed in those who had taken part in the most recent major wave. Regarding data quality, the incentivised group showed lower break-off rates and spent more time completing the survey. Therefore, the incentive had a significant positive effect on response rates and some aspects of data quality. Future research should evaluate the effect of incentives in relation to other modes of data collection and consider alternative strategies to improve response rates for previous non-respondents, who are considered harder to reach.},

For web-based surveys, it has not been possible to administer monetary incentives via the Internet in advance. Recently, several new web-based services have been introduced that can transfer money to people online. Does this really have the same positive effect on response rates as shown in traditional mail surveys? The authors investigated this question experimentally in the context of a web-based survey among members of a professional association in Virginia. The results indicate that prepaid incentives in web surveys seem to have no advantages concerning the willingness to participate, actual completion rates, and the share of incomplete response patterns when compared with postpaid incentives. Furthermore, postpaid incentives show no advantages over no incentives. Finally, compared to no incentives, prize draws increase completion rates and also reduce various incomplete participation patterns.},

  abstract = {AIM: To examine if a small token monetary incentive (NZ\$5) increases mail survey response rates and participant retention of 40-50 year old New Zealand women. METHOD: In 2009, 2500 women were randomly selected from the New Zealand electoral rolls for a prospective study investigating factors related to the prevention of weight gain. At baseline, 400 women were randomly assigned to receive NZ\$5 with the initial survey mail-out in addition to nonmonetary gifts to encourage participation (pen, tea bag, entry in lottery draw) received by all women. At 2 years, 400 women (200 received NZ\$5 at baseline and 200 had not) were randomly assigned to receive the same token monetary incentive. At 3 years, all women identifying as an ethnic minority (n=234) and 300 randomly selected women of other ethnicities received the token monetary incentive with the initial mail out. RESULTS: The baseline response rate for women who received NZ\$5 was significantly higher than for women who did not (76\% vs 64\%, p{$<$}0.001). At 2 years, retention rate for all women who received NZ\$5 was significantly higher than for women who did not (88\% vs 80\%, p{$<$}0.001). At 3 years, among those women not identifying as an ethnic minority, the retention rate for those who received NZ\$5 was significantly higher than for those who did not (84\% vs 77\%, p=0.014). CONCLUSION: Inclusion of a small token monetary incentive significantly increases mail survey response rates and participant retention in mid-age New Zealand women.},

The results provide further evidence that response rates in excess of 60\% can be achieved in mail surveys of the general public and of businesses. However, contrary to previous findings that response rates of this magnitude could be achieved without an incentive by sending two follow-up mailouts, the studies reported here required the use of an incentive to obtain this result. Fifty cent and \$1 coins were the most effective incentives, with the 50 cent incentive generally the most cost-effective. A 20 cent incentive, an Instant Kiwi, and the promise of a \$1 donation to a charity, also increased response rates above a no incentive control.},

Invitations were sent to a sample of 17,808 addresses in Boston, Massachusetts, recruiting for a new online panel study of city residents. We report response rates and costs for each condition. Findings suggest that letters achieve higher response rates than postcards and are more cost effective overall. We also find that conditional incentives achieve higher response rates and are more cost effective, although conflating factors do not permit clear inferences. Notably, the novel scratch-off postcard condition achieved the lowest response rate and the highest costs per completed survey.},

Our results are based on a quasi-experiment that varies which families receive an incentive offer letter.

The treatment group received £20 incentives instead of the usual £10 received at previous waves and by the control group. The results show a positive effect of the increased incentive on response rates for previous wave non-respondents and that this effect is heterogeneous across certain subgroups. The positive effect on response rates could translate into reduced fieldwork efforts in a web and CAPI sequential design.},

  abstract = {Steadily declining response rates lead to an increased usage of incentives in all kind of surveys. As for mail surveys, much empirical evidence supporting the usage of unconditional incentives is available (Berk, Mathiowetz, Ward and White 1987; Church 1993). For face-to-face studies, however, fewer results are available, and even less often in experimental settings (Martin, Abreu and Winters 2001; Singer, Hoewyk, Gebler, Raghunathan and McGonagle 1999). We conducted a three wave panel CAPI survey (N=600), where respondents were randomly assigned to three experimental groups: the first group received an unconditional incentive in form of a 10 Euro voucher, the second group was promised a 10 Euro voucher conditional upon participation, the third group was a control group that received no incentive. The allocation to a given experimental group was constant across the three waves and interviewers were kept blind to the experimental conditions. This research adds to the methodological literature in several ways: firstly, we compared the effectiveness of prepaid and conditional monetary incentives in a face-to-face interview in cross-sectional and longitudinal perspective, and found that conditional incentives performed significantly better in retaining respondents till the third wave. Secondly, we controlled for accurateness of the interviewers’ work on the field, and found evidence that improving selection and training of interviewers remains mandatory, since poor quality in the interviewer pool cannot be compensated by incentives.},

  abstract = {To encourage survey participation and improve sample representativeness, the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) offers an unconditional pre-paid monetary incentive and separate post-paid incentive upon survey completion. We conducted a pre-registered between-subject randomized control experiment within the 2022 SCF, with at least 1,200 households per experimental group, to examine whether changing the pre-paid incentive structure affects survey outcomes. We assess the effects of: (1) altering the total dollar value of the pre-paid incentive (“incentive effect”), (2) giving two identical pre-paid incentives holding the total dollar value fixed (“reminder effect”), and (3) offering multiple pre-paid incentives of different amounts holding the total dollar value fixed (“slope effect”) on survey response rates, interviewer burden, and data quality. Our evidence indicates that a single \$15 pre-paid incentive increases response rates and maintains similar levels of interviewer burden and data quality, relative to a single \$5 pre-paid incentive. Splitting the \$15 into two pre-paid incentives of different amounts increases interviewer burden though lengthening time in the field without improving response rates, reducing the number of contact attempts needed for a response, or improving data quality, regardless of whether the first pre-paid is larger or smaller than the second.},

STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Subjects older than 15 years of age and had been living in the two selected districts for more than 6 months were selected using multistage random sampling. Participants from only one district received a cash incentive (CNY 10) for completing the survey. RESULTS: The participation rates in the nonincentive and incentive groups were 39.9\% and 61.2\%, respectively, P {$<$} 0.01. In the nonincentive group, the 65-74 years age group had the highest participation rate (54.4\%); no significant difference was found between men (39.4\%) and women (40.5\%), P = 0.59. In the incentive group, the highest participation rate was observed in the ≥75 years (78.1\%) age group. The cost for a completed interview was CNY 34.5 in the incentive group and CNY 35.8 in the nonincentive group. CONCLUSION: Cash incentives might increase participation rates in face-to-face surveys in China. The absolute cost was higher for the incentive group, whereas cost for a completed interview was actually the lowest. Furthermore, participation rate did not differ between men and women, but elders were more likely to participate in health surveys.},

Results were generated using an analysis of variance approach. The overall effect size across the 74 observations was reported as low to moderate at d=.241. When compared across incentive types, only those surveys that included rewards (both monetary and nonmonetary) in the initial mailing yielded statistically significant estimates of effect size (d=.347, d=.136). The average increase in response rates over control conditions for these types of incentives was 19.1 percent and 7.9 percent, respectively.

We consider an alternative population—a pro-social population—and ask whether these same conclusions apply. Methods To evaluate the relative effectiveness of different incentive strategies, we randomly assign individuals to one of five conditions. We consider altruistic incentives (a narrative appeal or a charitable donation) and monetary incentives (three separate lotteries). Results Among pro-social individuals, “less is more”: altruistic appeals are just as effective, if not more effective, than costly monetary incentives. Moreover, the simplest lottery structure (fewer large-payoff prizes) is the most cost effective of the lotteries. Conclusions The target population of interest matters when designing survey incentive strategies. Moreover, increasing the incentives budget is not always beneficial.},

Cases and matched community controls were sent a letter introducing the study. One week later, a nurse called to invite the person to participate in a 30-minute telephone interview. After 1 year of data collection (which began in June 2001), the authors began enclosing a \$5.00 bill in the initial letter as an incentive. Incentives were mailed to all potential controls. The authors randomized 50\% of a subset of cases to receive the incentive. In the year prior to institution of the incentive, 44.2\% of 851 controls participated in the interview, as compared with 56.2\% of 1,043 controls in the year after the incentive was instituted (p \&lt; 0.001). Among cases randomized to receive the incentive (n = 199), 63.8\% participated as compared with 68.4\% in the nonincentive group (n = 193) (p \&gt; 0.05). Among cases aged 60–69 years, the response rate in the incentive group was reduced by 17\% (p = 0.03). Thus, among controls, a small monetary incentive appears to promote a feeling of goodwill toward the research. It does not seem to have an equivalent effect among cases, and in the worst case it may insult or annoy some cases who may otherwise have participated.},

  abstract = {Firm-level data from executives are necessary for testing many theories in organizational science. To date, researchers who have used survey methods to get data from executives have relied on response-rate techniques that were validated in general public, customer-, or employee-level populations. In a factorial field experiment, we manipulated the four most strongly supported of these techniques: incentives (gifts), advance notice, follow-up, and personalization. We also examined firm size as a potential moderator of their effects. In addition, we tested whether these response-rate enhancements affected the psychometric quality (acquiescence, self-presentation bias) of the executive survey data. Despite high statistical power(n = 1,200, 1-β≥.95), none of the conventional response-rate enhancement techniques were effective. Small influences on response acquiescence were found but these were confined to questions that arguably had the strongest demand cues. We conclude that distinctly different techniques may be needed to generate interest and involvement among executives targeted by firm-level mail surveys, and we provide some suggestions.},

  abstract = {A prior study found that mailing prepaid incentives with \$5 cash visible from outside the envelope increased the response rate to a mail survey by 4 percentage points compared to cash that was not externally visible. This “visible cash effect” suggests opportunities to improve survey response at little or no cost, but many unknowns remain. Among them: Does the visible cash effect generalize to different survey modes, respondent burdens, and cash amounts? Does it differ between fresh samples and reinterview samples? Does it affect data quality or survey costs? This article examines these questions using two linked studies where incentive visibility was randomized in a large probability sample for the American National Election Studies. The first study used \$10 incentives with invitations to a long web questionnaire (median 71\,minutes, n\,=\,17,849). Visible cash increased response rates in a fresh sample for both screener and extended interview response (by 6.7 and 4.8 percentage points, respectively). Visible cash did not increase the response rate in a reinterview sample where the baseline reinterview response rate was very high (72 percent). The second study used \$5 incentives with invitations to a mail-back paper questionnaire (n\,=\,8,000). Visible cash increased the response rate in a sample of prior nonrespondents by 4.0 percentage points (from 31.5 to 35.5), but it did not increase the response rate in a reinterview sample where the baseline reinterview rate was very high (84 percent). In the two studies, several aspects of data quality were investigated, including speeding, non-differentiation, item nonresponse, nonserious responses, noncredible responses, sample composition, and predictive validity; no adverse effects of visible cash were detected, and sample composition improved marginally. Effects on survey costs were either negligible or resulted in net savings. Accumulated evidence now shows that visible cash can increase incentives’ effectiveness in several circumstances.},

The effectiveness of incentives has generally been shown to be positive, but results have been mixed for conditional incentives and for online surveys. Using an experimental design and leverage-salience theory, the survey uses a random sample of full-time undergraduate students to estimate group differences. Both official and self-report data are utilized to assess various social statistics. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three different groups, which determined whether they were offered five dollars, two dollars, or nothing for their participation. Results indicate that a five-dollar conditional reward credited to students’ campus ID card account does increase participation rates, which does improve the representativeness of the sample by reducing differences in GPA and gender proportions. The difference in representativeness, however, does not appear to significantly bias substantive conclusions.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Low response rates are acknowledged as a potential source of bias in survey results. Response rates are a particular problem in surveys of GPs. Thus, the methods used to encourage response to mailed surveys and the influence of inducements in maximizing response rates are fundamental issues to be examined when addressing the problem of response bias. AIM: To increase the overall response rate to a national study of GPs and to explore the effects of financial and non-financial inducements on response rates. METHODS: Two mailing waves of a postal questionnaire to a 20\% random sample of all GPs in England and Wales had achieved a 33\% response rate. For the third mailing wave, the non-responding GPs were then divided into a control group, a group who were offered a donation to charity to complete the questionnaire and a group who were offered cash. The charity and cash groups were further subdivided into 5 pounds and 10 pounds groups to assess the effect of the size of the inducement offered. For the control group, a fourth wave was sent the offer of a 5 pounds or 10 pounds incentive. RESULTS: Response was positively affected by the offer of an inducement. Cash, however, had a more substantial effect than the offer of a donation to charity. Older GPs were less likely to participate overall, whereas male GPs were more likely to respond to a cash inducement. Doctors who had seen more patients were less likely to reply earlier and were more likely to respond to the offer of cash. CONCLUSIONS: Primary care is going through many changes, some of which have increased the workload of the GP. It may now be that, to achieve the response rates needed to validate policy-related research, the offer of inducements will become a necessary part of the research process.},

  abstract = {Background Historically, achieving a high response rate on physician surveys has been a challenging task. Given such concerns, understanding research strategies that facilitate adequate response rates is important. Primary care physician responses to a mail survey on smoking cessation are summarized by physician specialty and timing of incentive. Methods A stratified random-sample design, stratified by patient populations—adults, adolescents, and pregnant women—was used. The sampling frame included New Jersey internists, general practitioners, family physicians, pediatricians, and obstetrician–gynecologists. A total of 2100 physicians, 700 physicians from each patient strata, were sampled and mailed a smoking-cessation survey in summer 2002. The sample was randomized by incentive timing: Half received the incentive (i.e., \$25 gift card) with the first survey mailing, and half received the incentive on receipt of their completed survey. Results The promised-incentive group achieved a significantly lower response rate (56\%) compared with the up-front–incentive group (71.5\%). Response rates by medical specialty varied overall and within incentive groups. The difference between the incentive groups was greatest among obstetrician–gynecologists (i.e., 20.2 percentage points) and was least among pediatricians (i.e., 5.8 percentage points). Conclusions Physician response rates to mail surveys are greatly improved, especially among certain medical specialties, by using up-front incentives.},

Enhancing questionnaires with visual elements, such as product images, lead to a higher response quality and generate interesting interaction effects with the length of the questionnaire and the incentives used.

METHODS: A sample of 1,150 individuals, randomly selected from a database of members of the Canadian Association of Retired Persons (CARP), was e-mailed a request to participate in an online survey, with follow-up e-mails after 1 and 2 weeks. The sample was randomly split into two groups. Half the sample was offered entry into a cash draw with a \$500 grand prize and five \$100 prizes, whereas the other half was not offered any incentive. In addition, a brief advertisement about the survey (without an incentive) was placed in an online newsletter that was circulated to 14,000 randomly selected CARP members. RESULTS: In the incentive group, 305 (53.0\%) clicked on the hyperlink and visited the website and 84 (14.6\%) completed the survey. In the group who received no incentive, 280 (48.7\%) clicked on the link and 59 (10.3\%) completed the survey. Of those who received the online newsletter, 492 (3.5\%) visited the website and 106 (0.76\%) completed the survey. CONCLUSION: A relatively modest financial incentive in the form of a cash lottery significantly increased participation rates in an online health survey. Recruitment through a newsletter advertisement had a very low yield compared to direct e-mail.},

Overall, 51.5\% of the physicians returned the mailed surveys. Comparison of logit models showed that inclusion of a \$5 check in the mailer significantly (p = .016) increased the probability of returning the surveys (57.5\% vs. 45.5\%). In contrast, the telephone follow-up had no overall effect. The authors concluded a modest financial reward can significantly improve physician response rates to research surveys but a telephone follow-up may be inefficient and even ineffective.},

The authors conducted a randomized trial of financial incentives and delivery methods to identify the least costly approach for increasing overall participation. They randomly selected nine samples of 300 nonresponders each to receive combinations of no, 1.00 US dollar, 2.00 US dollars, and 5.00 US dollars cash or check incentives delivered by first-class mail or Federal Express. Federal Express delivery did not achieve greater participation than first-class mail (23.2\% vs. 23.7\%). In analyses pooled across delivery methods, the response was significantly greater for the 2.00 US dollar bill (28.9\%, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 25.2, 32.7; p {$<$} 0.0001), 5.00 US dollars check (27.5\%, 95\% CI: 22.5, 33.0; p = 0.0001), 1.00 US dollar bill (24.6\%, 95\% CI: 21.2, 28.3; p = 0.0007), and 2.00 US dollars check (21.8\%, 95\% CI: 18.5, 25.3; p = 0.02) compared with no incentive (16.6\%, 95\% CI: 13.7, 19.9).

Study Design and Setting The PCPs were randomized into three arms (n=550 per arm), namely (1) €5 sent with the questionnaire (cash); (2) entry into a draw on return of completed questionnaire (prize); or (3) no incentive. Effects of incentives on response rates and item nonresponse were examined, as was cost-effectiveness. Results Response rates were significantly higher in the cash (66.1\%; 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 61.9, 70.4\%) and prize arms~(44.8\%; 95\% CI: 40.1, 49.3\%) compared with the no-incentive arm (39.9\%; 95\% CI: 35.4, 44.3\%). Adjusted relative risk of response was 1.17 (95\% CI: 1.02, 1.35) and 1.68 (95\% CI: 1.48, 1.91) in the prize and cash arms, respectively, compared with the no-incentive group. Costs per completed questionnaire were €9.85, €11.15, and €6.31 for the cash, prize, and no-incentive arms, respectively. Compared with the no-incentive arm, costs per additional questionnaire returned in the cash and prize arms were €14.72 and €37.20, respectively. Conclusion Both a modest cash incentive and entry into a prize draw were effective in increasing response rates. The cash incentive was most effective and the most cost-effective. Where it is important to maximize response, a modest cash incentive may be cost-effective.},

  abstract = {We show how to use randomized participation incentives to test and account for nonresponse bias in surveys. We first use data from a survey about labor market conditions, linked to full-population administrative data, to provide evidence of large differences in labor market outcomes between survey participants and nonparticipants, differences which would not be observable to an analyst who only has access to the survey data. These differences persist even after correcting for observable characteristics. We then use the randomized incentives in our survey to directly test for nonresponse bias, and find evidence of substantial bias. Next, we apply a range of existing methods that account for nonresponse bias and find they produce bounds (or point estimates) that are either wide or far from the ground truth. We investigate the failure of these methods by taking a closer look at the determinants of participation, finding that the composition of participants changes in opposite directions in response to incentives and reminder emails. We develop a model of participation that allows for two dimensions of unobserved heterogeneity in the participation decision. Applying the model to our data produces bounds (or point estimates) that are narrower and closer to the ground truth than the other methods. Our results highlight the benefits of including randomized participation incentives in surveys. Both the testing procedure and the methods for bias adjustment may be attractive tools for researchers who are able to embed randomized incentives into their survey.},

While absolute costs were the highest for the cash group, the cost per completed survey was the lowest. The incentives had limited effects on response distributions for specific survey questions. Although respondents completing the survey by mail in the cash and coupon groups exhibited a trend toward being less likely to have missing data, the effect was not significant. Compared to a coupon or no incentive, a small cash incentive significantly improved response rates and was cost effective among African American respondents in Wisconsin PRAMS. Incentives had only limited effects, however, on survey response distributions, and no significant effects on item nonresponse.},

Results indicated that the response rates were highest in the groups promised \$100 and \$50, respectively. While the postal prenotification letter increased response rates, the inclusion of a small token \$2 preincentive had no effect on participation. Further, unlike mail surveys of physicians, the \$2 preincentive was not cost-effective.

  abstract = {In late 2018, the Journal of Operations Management published an invited methods article by Lonati et al. (2018) to provide guidance to authors on how to design behavioral experiments to achieve the rigor required for consideration in the journal. That article was written as a response to a number of behavioral research submissions to JOM, each dealing with interesting topics but viewed by the editors to possess poor design choices at inception. While the Lonati et al. (2018) piece provides experimental guidance fitting to certain research agendas, questions have arisen concerning whether and how exactly to implement some of the points that it makes, and how to best address trade-offs in the design of behavioral experiments. Questions have also arisen concerning how to apply these concepts in operations management (OM) research. This technical note seeks to address these questions, by diving into the details of research risks and trade-offs regarding demand effects, incentives, deception, sample selection, and context-rich vignettes. The authors would like to recognize the input of a large number of senior scholars in the JOM community who have provided support and feedback as we have sought to help authors tease out what can reasonably be done in designing strong behavioral experiments that fit various research agendas.},

Design Systematic review of randomised controlled trials of any method to influence response to postal questionnaires. Studies reviewed 292 randomised controlled trials including 258 315 participants Intervention reviewed 75 strategies for influencing response to postal questionnaires. Main outcome measure The proportion of completed or partially completed questionnaires returned. Results The odds of response were more than doubled when a monetary incentive was used (odds ratio 2.02; 95\% confidence interval 1.79 to 2.27) and almost doubled when incentives were not conditional on response (1.71; 1.29 to 2.26). Response was more likely when short questionnaires were used (1.86; 1.55 to 2.24). Personalised questionnaires and letters increased response (1.16; 1.06 to 1.28), as did the use of coloured ink (1.39; 1.16 to 1.67). The odds of response were more than doubled when the questionnaires were sent by recorded delivery (2.21; 1.51 to 3.25) and increased when stamped return envelopes were used (1.26; 1.13 to 1.41) and questionnaires were sent by first class post (1.12; 1.02 to 1.23). Contacting participants before sending questionnaires increased response (1.54; 1.24 to 1.92), as did follow up contact (1.44; 1.22 to 1.70) and providing non-respondents with a second copy of the questionnaire (1.41; 1.02 to 1.94). Questionnaires designed to be of more interest to participants were more likely to be returned (2.44; 1.99 to 3.01), but questionnaires containing questions of a sensitive nature were less likely to be returned (0.92; 0.87 to 0.98). Questionnaires originating from universities were more likely to be returned than were questionnaires from other sources, such as commercial organisations (1.31; 1.11 to 1.54). Conclusions Health researchers using postal questionnaires can improve the quality of their research by using the strategies shown to be effective in this systematic review.},

  abstract = {Study objective: To quantify the increase in mailed questionnaire response attributable to a monetary incentive. Design: A systematic search for randomised controlled trials of monetary incentives and mailed questionnaire response was conducted. For each trial identified, logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratio for response per \$0.01 incentive increase. Odds ratios were pooled in a series of random effect meta-analyses stratified by the minimum and maximum amounts offered. Piecewise logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratio for response per \$0.01 increase given in each of five incentive ranges. Setting: Populations in several developed countries, predominantly the USA. Participants: 85 671 randomised participants from 88 trials. Main results: The pooled odds ratios for response per \$0.01 incentive decreased monotonically as the maximum amount of incentive offered increased. The piecewise logistic regression model estimated that for incentive amounts up to \$0.50, each additional \$0.01 increased the odds of response by about 1\% (pooled OR = 1.012, 95\%CI 1.007 to 1.016). The effects on response above \$0.50 were smaller and decreased monotonically in the ranges: \$0.50–0.99, \$1–1.99, \$2–4.99, \$5.00 and over, but remained statistically significant up to \$5. Conclusions: This meta-analysis of the best available evidence shows that monetary incentives increase mailed questionnaire response. Researchers should include small amounts of money with mailed questionnaires rather than give no incentive at all.},

  abstract = {Aim: Financial incentives improve response to electronic health surveys, yet little is known about how unconditional incentives (guaranteed regardless of survey completion), conditional incentives, and various combinations of incentives influence response rates. We compared electronic health survey completion with two different financial incentive structures.Methods: We invited women aged 30-64 years enrolled in a U.S. healthcare system and overdue for Pap screening to complete a web-based survey after receiving a mailed human papillomavirus (HPV) self-sampling kit in a pragmatic trial. HPV kit returners (n = 272) and non-returners (n = 1,083) were allocated to one of two different incentive structures: (1) Unconditional: \$5 pre-incentive only (n = 653); (2) Combined: \$2 pre-incentive plus \$10 post-incentive conditional on completion (n = 702). Chi-square tests evaluated whether survey completion differed by incentive structure within kit return groups or was modified by kit return status. For each incentive-by-kit status group, the cost-per-survey response was calculated as: ([number invited*pre-incentive amount] + [number responses*post-incentive amount]) / number responses.Results: Overall, survey response was higher in kit returners vs. kit non-returners (42.6\% vs. 11.0\%, P \&lt; 0.01), and survey response was higher in the combined (20.1\%) vs. unconditional (14.4\%) incentive group (P = 0.01). Kit return status did not modify the association between incentive type and survey response (P = 0.52). Among respondents, time to survey completion did not differ by incentive type among either kit returners or non-returners. Among returners, the cost-per-survey response was similar between groups (\$13.57 unconditional; \$14.15 combined); among non-returners, the cost was greater in the unconditional (\$57.78) versus the combined (\$25.22) group.Conclusion: A combined incentive can be cost-effective for increasing survey response in health services research, particularly in hard-to-reach populations.},

However, recent research has shown that gains in response rate and reduced data collection costs associated with monetary incentives may vary across sub-groups in the population. Consequently, monetary incentives may result in inconsistent reductions in non-response error and systemic changes in sample composition. This paper describes an incentive experiment conducted as part of the 2001 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse(NHSDA), and evaluates the impact of monetary incentives on measures of cooperation for different population sub-groups. Findings indicate that the incentive had a positive impact on cooperation. Furthermore, the incentive neither introduced additional differences in cooperation propensities, nor did it eliminate the pre-existing differences in cooperation among population sub-groups.}

To contribute to the research, we analyze an incentive experiment embedded within the third wave of the German household panel survey “Panel Labor Market and Social Security” conducted by the German Institute for Employment Research. Our question is whether attrition bias differs in two incentive plans. In particular, we want to study whether an unconditional €10 cash incentive yields less attrition bias in self-reported labor income and other sociodemographics than a conditional lottery ticket incentive. We find that unconditional cash incentives are more effective than conditional lottery tickets in reducing attrition bias in income and several sociodemographic variables.},

  abstract = {This two-part methodologic research was designed to evaluate the effects of a financial incentive on questionnaire response rate and response bias for general dentists surveyed by mail. Subjects were 517 clinicians randomly selected from a two-state population of practitioners insured by a single malpractice liability carrier. Subjects received a check for either \textbackslash 5 or \textbackslash 10 in the original mailing. In Study 1, a single mailing and postcard follow-up resulted in a 57.8 percent (111/192) response rate. In Study 2, employing Dillman's Total Design Method, a 69.6 percent (208/299) response was obtained after a third mailing. Analysis of response rate by incentive level in each study revealed no significant differences. In contrast, early responders (first mailing and follow-up postcard) differed from late responders (second and third mailings) on age (41.4 vs 37.0 years; T=-2.17; P=.032), non-Caucasians (27.7\% vs 63.9\%; χ2=17.3; df=4; P{$<$}.002), females (13.9\% vs 27.8\%; χ2=3.9; df=1; P{$<$}. 05), foreign-trained (7.0\% vs 19.4\%; χ2=16.5; df=2; P{$<$}.001), and dissatisfaction with practice (31\% vs 51\%; χ2=7.8; df=4; P =. 10). Thus, the magnitude of the financial incentive in this experiment had no differential effect on response rate. But differences in responses from late responders (proxies for nonresponders) on demographic characteristics and key study variables suggest the persistence of response bias despite an acceptable response rate. Future dental health survey research should employ tests for response bias on both sets of variables.},

The control group in each trial received standard Txt2stop procedures.Results Trial 1: 3.6\% (17/470) of the intervention group and 1.1\% (5/467) of the control group registered for the trial, risk difference 2.5\% (95\% CI 0.6—4.5). 0\% (0/ 470) of the intervention group and 0.2\% (1/467) of the control group registered successfully online, risk difference —0.2 (95\% CI —0.6—0.2); Trial 2: 4.5\% (11/246) of the intervention group and 0.4\% (1/245) of the control group were randomized into the Txt2stop trial, risk difference 4.0\% (95\% CI 1.4—6.7); Trial 3: 3.5\% (14/405) of the intervention group and 0\% (0/406) of the control group were randomized into the Txt2stop trial, risk difference 3.5 (95\% CI 1.7—5.2).Limitations There were no baseline data available for trial 1. Allocation of participant IDs in trials 2 and 3 were systematic.Conclusion Sending a text message about an online registration facility increased registrations to Txt2stop, but did not increase online registrations. Sending a £5 reimbursement for participants’ time and sending text messages containing quotes from existing participants increased randomizations into the Txt2stop trial.

Six hundred subjects were randomly assigned to four groups. One group received a mail survey from “Leroy Jefferson,” apparently a Black individual, with a 25\% monetary incentive included. Group two also received a questionnaire from “Leroy Jefferson,” but without the monetary incentive. Groups three (25 ϕ included) and four (no monetary incentive) were sent questionnaires from “John Richardson,” an ethnically unidentifiable sponsor. The questionnaire was a 16-item attitudes towards Black scale. The results of the study demonstrated the value of a monetary incentive in increasing the rate of response. The name of the sponsor, however, did not affect either the rate of response or the quality of response (i. e. the scores on the attitude scale).},

The survey was administered using a mixed-mode approach, in which community members were invited to participate using a traditional mailed letter using contact information for a representative sample of the community; but individuals completed the survey via the web, which exploited the advantages of electronic capture. Individuals were randomized to four incentive groups: (a) no incentive, (b) prepaid cash incentive (\$2), (c) a low lottery (10 prizes of \$25) and (d) a high lottery (2 prizes of \$250). Letters of invitation were mailed to 3,000 individuals. In total, 405 individuals (14.4\%) contacted the website and 277 (9.8\%) provided complete responses. The prepaid cash incentive generated the highest contact and response rates (23.3 and 17.3\%, respectively), and no incentive generated the lowest (9.1 and 5.7\%, respectively). The high lottery, however, was the most cost-effective incentive for obtaining completed surveys: compared with no incentive, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per completed survey for high lottery was \$13.89; for prepaid cash, the ICER was \$18.29. This finding suggests that the preferred response incentive for community-based, stated-preference surveys is a lottery with a small number of large prizes.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sending a monetary incentive with postal questionnaires has been found to improve the proportion of responders, in research in non-healthcare settings. However, there is little research on use of incentives to improve follow-up rates in clinical trials, and existing studies are inconclusive. We conducted a randomised trial among participants in the Managing Injuries of the Neck Trial (MINT) to investigate the effects on the proportion of questionnaires returned and overall non-response of sending a 5 pounds gift voucher with a follow-up questionnaire. METHODS: Participants in MINT were randomised to receive either: (a) a 5 POUNDSgift voucher (incentive group) or (b) no gift voucher (no incentive group), with their 4 month or 8 month follow-up questionnaire. We recorded, for each group, the number of questionnaires returned, the number returned without any chasing from the study office, the overall number of non-responders (after all chasing efforts by the study office), and the costs of following up each group. RESULTS: 2144 participants were randomised, 1070 to the incentive group and 1074 to the no incentive group. The proportion of questionnaires returned (RR 1.10 (95\% CI 1.05, 1.16)) and the proportion returned without chasing (RR 1.14 (95\% CI 1.05, 1.24) were higher in the incentive group, and the overall non-response rate was lower (RR 0.68 (95\% CI 0.53, 0.87)). Adjustment for injury severity and hospital of recruitment to MINT made no difference to these results, and there were no differences in results between the 4-month and 8-month follow up questionnaires. Analysis of costs suggested a cost of 67.29 POUNDS per additional questionnaire returned. CONCLUSION: Monetary incentives may be an effective way to increase the proportion of postal questionnaires returned and minimise loss to follow-up in clinical trials.

However, the choices made in setting up the models (e.g., inclusion of predictors based on statistical significance) do not map directly into decision procedures. Bayesian inference works more naturally with decision analysis but presents problems in practice when noninformative prior distributions are used with sparse data. We do not attempt to provide a general solution to this problem, but rather present an application of a decision problem in which inferences from a regression model are used to estimate costs and benefits. Our example is a reanalysis of a recent meta-analysis of incentives for reducing survey nonresponse. We then apply the results of our fitted model to the New York City Social Indicators Survey, a biennial telephone survey with a high nonresponse rate. We consider the balance of estimated costs, cost savings, and response rate for different choices of incentives. The explicit analysis of the decision problem reveals the importance of interactions in the fitted regression model.},

In this study, the authors used a mailed survey of a low-income population to test whether \$1.00 or \$2.00 cash-response incentives were worth the expense and whether 2-day priority mail (\$2.90 postage) would yield a sufficiently higher response rate than certified mail (\$1.52 postage) to justify its cost. In 1994, 2,243 randomly selected families in subsidized health care programs in Pierce County, Washington, were randomly sent no incentive, \$1.00, or \$2.00 in the first of three mailings. For the third mailing, nonrespondents were randomly assigned to receive either certified or 2-day priority mail. After 4 weeks, the response rates were 36.7\%, 48.1\%, and 50.3\% for the no-incentive, \$1.00, and \$2.00 groups, respectively. After three mailings, the cost per response was the lowest for the group that received \$1.00. The response rate for the certified mailing (28.1\%) was significantly higher than the rate for the more expensive priority mailing (21.7\%). No incentive-related bias was detected. The authors concluded that the most efficient protocol for this low-income population was to use a \$1.00 incentive in the first mailing and a certified third mailing.},

Mail questionnaires are one commonly used method to survey user preferences. Research methods which increase response rates and quality of mail surveys can help result in the design of products that more accurately reflect market needs. This study examines the effect of a nominal monetary gift and different contacting approaches on mail survey response rates among a population of engineers. The study found that the inclusion of a nominal monetary gift had a dramatic effect on survey response rates among engineers. Precontact with targeted firms was also found to increase survey response rates. Additionally, this research found differences in the response rates between direct precontact of subjects in target firms versus indirect contact of engineers who were referred as CAD experts in their firms.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Questionnaire surveys are important for surveying the health and disease behaviour of the population, but recent years have seen a fall in participation. Our study tested whether incentives can increase participation in these surveys.MATERIAL AND METHOD We sent a questionnaire on risk factors for colorectal cancer (height, weight, smoking, self-reported diagnoses, family medical history) to non-screened participants in a randomised colonoscopy screening study for colorectal cancer: participants who were invited but did not attend for colonoscopy examination (screening-invited) and persons who were not offered colonoscopy (control group). The persons were randomised to three groups: no financial incentive, lottery scratch cards included with the form, or a prize draw for a tablet computer when they responded to the form. We followed up all the incentive groups with telephone reminder calls, and before the prize draw for the tablet computer.RESULTS Altogether 3 705 of 6 795 persons (54.5\,\,\%) responded to the questionnaire; 43.5\,\,\% of those invited for screening and 65.6\,\,\% of the control group (p {$<$} 0.001). The proportion that answered was not influenced by incentives, either among those invited for screening (42.4\,\,\% in the non-prize group, 45.5\,\,\% in the lottery scratch card group and 42.6\,\,\% in the prize draw group; p = 0.24), or in the control group (65.6\,\,\% in the non-prize group, 66.4\,\,\% in the lottery scratch card group and 64.7\,\,\% in the prize draw group; p = 0.69). Prior to reminder calls, 39.2\,\,\% responded. A further 15.3\,\,\% responded following telephone reminder calls (14.1\,\,\% of the screening-invited and 16.5\,\,\% of the control group; p {$<$} 0.001).INTERPRETATION Incentives did not increase participation in this medical questionnaire survey. Use of telephone reminder calls and telephone interviews increased participation, but whether this is more effective than other methods requires further study.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Healthcare professional response rates to postal questionnaires are declining and this may threaten the validity and generalisability of their findings. Methods to improve response rates do incur costs (resources) and increase the cost of research projects. The aim of these randomised controlled trials (RCTs) was to assess whether 1) incentives, 2) type of reminder and/or 3) reduced response burden improve response rates; and to assess the cost implications of such additional effective interventions. METHODS: Two RCTs were conducted. In RCT A general dental practitioners (dentists) in Scotland were randomised to receive either an incentive; an abridged questionnaire or a full length questionnaire. In RCT B non-responders to a postal questionnaire sent to general medical practitioners (GPs) in the UK were firstly randomised to receive a second full length questionnaire as a reminder or a postcard reminder. Continued non-responders from RCT B were then randomised within their first randomisation to receive a third full length or an abridged questionnaire reminder. The cost-effectiveness of interventions that effectively increased response rates was assessed as a secondary outcome. RESULTS: There was no evidence that an incentive (52\% versus 43\%, Risk Difference (RD) -8.8 (95\%CI -22.5, 4.8); or abridged questionnaire (46\% versus 43\%, RD -2.9 (95\%CI -16.5, 10.7); statistically significantly improved dentist response rates compared to a full length questionnaire in RCT A. In RCT B there was no evidence that a full questionnaire reminder statistically significantly improved response rates compared to a postcard reminder (10.4\% versus 7.3\%, RD 3 (95\%CI -0.1, 6.8). At a second reminder stage, GPs sent the abridged questionnaire responded more often (14.8\% versus 7.2\%, RD -7.7 (95\%CI -12.8, -2.6). GPs who received a postcard reminder followed by an abridged questionnaire were most likely to respond (19.8\% versus 6.3\%, RD 8.1\%, and 9.1\% for full/postcard/full, three full or full/full/abridged questionnaire respectively). An abridged questionnaire containing fewer questions following a postcard reminder was the only cost-effective strategy for increasing the response rate (£15.99 per response). CONCLUSIONS: When expecting or facing a low response rate to postal questionnaires, researchers should carefully identify the most efficient way to boost their response rate. In these studies, an abridged questionnaire containing fewer questions following a postcard reminder was the only cost-effective strategy. An increase in response rates may be explained by a combination of the number and type of contacts. Increasing the sampling frame may be more cost-effective than interventions to prompt non-responders. However, this may not strengthen the validity and generalisability of the survey findings and affect the representativeness of the sample.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To increase the overall 2007 response rate of the National Physician Survey (NPS) from the survey's 2004 rate of response with the implementation of various methodologic strategies. DESIGN: Physicians were stratified to receive either a long version (12 pages) or a short version (6 pages) of the survey (38\% and 62\%, respectively). Mixed modes of contact were used-58\% were contacted by e-mail and 42\% by regular mail-with multiple modes of contact attempted for nonrespondents. The self-administered, confidential surveys were distributed in either English or French. Medical residents and students received e-mail surveys only and were offered a substantial monetary lottery incentive for completing their surveys. A professional communications firm assisted in marketing the survey and delivered advance notification of its impending distribution. SETTING: Canada. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 62 441 practising physicians, 2627 second-year medical residents, and 9162 medical students in Canada. RESULTS: Of the practising physicians group, 60 811 participants were eligible and 19 239 replied, for an overall 2007 study response rate of 31.64\% (compared with 35.85\% in 2004). No difference in rate of response was found between the longer and shorter versions of the survey. If contacted by regular mail, the response rate was 34.1\%; the e-mail group had a response rate of 29.9\%. Medical student and resident response rates were 30.8\% and 27.9\%, respectively (compared with 31.2\% and 35.6\% in 2004). CONCLUSION: Despite shortening the questionnaires, contacting more physicians by e-mail, and enhancing marketing and follow-up, the 2007 NPS response rate for practising physicians did not surpass the 2004 NPS response rate. Offering a monetary lottery incentive to medical residents and students was also unsuccessful in increasing their response rates. The role of surveys in gathering information from physicians and physicians-in-training remains problematic. Researchers need to investigate alternative strategies for achieving higher rates of response.},

  abstract = {Objectives. To study the effects of several survey features on response rates in a general population health survey. Methods. In 2012 and 2013, 8000 households in British Columbia, Canada, were randomly allocated to 1 of 7 survey variants, each containing a different combination of survey features. Features compared included administration modes (paper vs online), prepaid incentive (\$2 coin vs none), lottery incentive (instant vs end-of-study), questionnaire length (10 minutes vs 30 minutes), and sampling frame (InfoCanada vs Canada Post). Results. The overall response rate across the 7 groups was 27.9\% (range\,=\,17.1–43.4). All survey features except the sampling frame were associated with statistically significant differences in response rates. The survey mode elicited the largest effect on the odds of response (odds ratio [OR]\,=\,2.04; 95\% confidence interval [CI]\,=\,1.61, 2.59), whereas the sampling frame showed the least effect (OR\,=\,1.14; 95\% CI\,=\,0.98, 1.34). The highest response was achieved by mailing a short paper survey with a prepaid incentive. Conclusions. In a mailed general population health survey in Canada, a 40\% to 50\% response rate can be expected. Questionnaire administration mode, survey length, and type of incentive affect response rates.},

Providing some form of incentive, whether monetary or some other kind of token of appreciation, is common for studies recruiting respondents to answer survey questions. The chapter provides a brief review of the literature on the effectiveness of incentives and the postulated mechanisms explaining these effects. It explains the study design with an emphasis on the experimental conditions. The chapter also presents an analysis of the results of the study, including overall effects of the different incentive treatments on app installation, number of initially activated data-sharing functions, deactivation of data-sharing functions, retention of app, and overall costs of data collection.},

  abstract = {Even small monetary incentives, e.g., a one-dollar bill in a postal invitation letter, can increase the response rate in a web survey. However, in the euro currency area, the smallest amount of monetary incentive for a postal invitation is a five-euro bill, which is costly. As such, we conducted a random experiment with prepaid stamp and postcard incentives as affordable alternatives. We compare the effect of our experimental groups with a control group in terms of response rates, response rates in a subsequent wave, data linkage consent, and data collection costs. Compared with the control group, the postcard incentive has no effect on our outcomes except overall costs. Using a prepaid stamp incentive increases the response rate overall but with different effect sizes for subgroups. We find no effect of stamp incentives on response rates in a subsequent wave or data linkage consent.},

Because this error is difficult to quantify, survey researchers seek high rates of return to signal legitimacy and reduce questions regarding nonresponse bias. Research on survey method indicates that the design of the survey research process has a measurable influence on the rate of survey returns. This article focuses on three aspects of research design that are expected to influence mail survey returns in surveys of nonprofit organizations: questionnaire complexity, use of Federal Express versus standard mail, and the use of monetary incentives. Using an experimental design, the research concludes that questionnaire complexity and the use of monetary incentives generate no difference in returns, whereas the use of Federal Express to deliver the survey to nonprofit executives has a measurable positive effect.},

  abstract = {Background: HIV prevention research often involves the use of online surveys as data collection instruments. Incomplete responses to these surveys can introduce bias. We aimed to develop and assess innovative methods to incentivize respondents to complete surveys. Methods: Adult men who have sex with men (MSM) living in the United States were recruited through banner advertisements on Facebook from April 27th, 2015 to May 6th, 2015 to participate in an online survey about HIV prevention and risk behaviors. Participants were randomized to one of four conditions: a monetary incentive; a series of altruistic messages highlighting the importance of participating in research; access to a dashboard comparing their responses to statistics from other participants after completion; and no incentive. Kaplan-Meier survival methods and univariate Cox proportional hazard models were used to evaluate survey dropout by incentive group and demographic variables of interest. Results: There were 1178 total participants randomized to the four treatment groups. The rate of survey dropout among participants in the altruistic (HR=0.68, 95\%CI: 0.49-0.93), monetary (HR=0.44, 95\%CI: 0.32-0.61) and dashboard group (HR=0.78, 95\%CI: 0.58-1.06) was lower than the non-incentivized control group. Regardless of condition, survey drop out was also lower among MSM aged 28-34 (HR=0.67, 95\%CI: 0.50-0.90) compared to 18-22 year olds and MSM who were white (HR=0.78, 95\%CI: 0.60-1.02) compared to non-white participants. Conclusions: Monetary incentives and altruistic messaging can improve survey completion in online behavioral HIV prevention research among MSM.},

Trial 2 compared a moderate-probability/moderate-payout lottery with an unconditional fixed payment (payment sent with questionnaire). Trial 3 compared a moderate-probability/moderate-payout lottery with a conditional fixed payment (payment promised following response). PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Neither the low-probability nor high-probability lotteries improved response compared with no incentive. Unconditional fixed payments produced significantly greater response than actuarially equivalent lotteries, but conditional fixed payments did not. CONCLUSIONS: Lottery-based incentives do not improve clinicians' response rates compared with no incentives, and they are inferior to unconditional fixed payments.},

However, the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of several strategies to increase response rates are uncertain.           Objectives. ~           To assess three strategies to increase response rates to mailed physician surveys: including a \$10 versus a \$5 cash incentive in the initial mailing, including a mint candy or not, and using a large versus small outgoing envelope.           Research Design and subjects. ~           Using a 2 × 2 × 2 factorial design, a randomized trial of these strategies was conducted in a survey of 1200 physicians randomly selected from the American Medical Association’s Master File.           Results. ~           Including a \$10 incentive yielded a significantly higher response rate (60.5\% vs. 52.8\%) (P = 0.009). The mailing and incentive costs per completed response were \$12.24 (95\% CI, \$11.75, \$13.64) in the \$5 group and \$18.48 (95\% CI, \$17.77, \$20.69) in the \$10 group. Each additional response obtained in the \$10 group came at an incremental cost of \$61.26 (95\% CI, \$36.98, \$200.80). Neither inclusion of a mint nor use of a large envelope influenced the response rate.           Conclusions. ~           Investigators may increase response rates by including more money in the initial questionnaire packet, but there may be diminishing returns to serial increments in incentives greater than \$5. Including smaller incentives in more questionnaires may maximize total responses.},

Experiments with prepaid cash incentives and special mail delivery methods were applied in both phases. For the screener, sampled addresses were randomly designated to receive either \$2 or \$5 in the initial mailing. During the topical phase, incentives (ranging from \$0 to \$20) and delivery methods (First Class Mail or Priority Mail) were assigned randomly but depended on how quickly the household had responded to the screener. The paper first evaluates the effects of incentives on response rates, and then examines incentive levels for attracting the hard-to-reach groups and improving sample composition. The impact of incentive on data collection cost is also examined.},

Results of this single-contact or nondelay foot application were mixed; compliance rates for the foot treatment groups lacked statistical significance when compared with those of appropriate control groups.

The study compares the effectiveness of high and low involvement foot manipulations in generating compliance with both short and long forms of a mail questionnaire. The high and the low involvement foot manipulations generate significantly higher response rates and faster response times than a noncontact control situation. In addition, the short form questionnaires generate a higher return rate. High involvement foot treatments generate higher response rates than low involvement foot treatments. Managerial implications of the results and suggestions for future research are presented.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Web-based surveys can be effective data collection instruments; however, participation is notoriously low, particularly among professionals such as physicians. Few studies have explored the impact of varying amounts of monetary incentives on survey completion. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to conduct a randomized study to assess how different incentive amounts influenced survey participation among neurologists in the United States. METHODS: We distributed a web-based survey using standardized email text to 21,753 individuals randomly divided into 5 equal groups (≈4351 per group). In phase 1, each group was assigned to receive either nothing or a gift card for US \$10, \$20, \$50, or \$75, which was noted in the email subject and text. After 4 reminders, phase 2 began and each remaining individual was offered a US \$75 gift card to complete the survey. We calculated and compared the proportions who completed the survey by phase 1 arm, both before and after the incentive change, using a chi-square test. As a secondary outcome, we also looked at survey participation as opposed to completion. RESULTS: For the 20,820 emails delivered, 879 (4.2\%) recipients completed the survey; of the 879 recipients, 622 (70.8\%) were neurologists. Among the neurologists, most were male (412/622, 66.2\%), White (430/622, 69.1\%), non-Hispanic (592/622, 95.2\%), graduates of American medical schools (465/622, 74.8\%), and board certified (598/622, 96.1\%). A total of 39.7\% (247/622) completed their neurology residency more than 20 years ago, and 62.4\% (388/622) practiced in an urban setting. For phase 1, the proportions of respondents completing the survey increased as the incentive amount increased (46/4185, 1.1\%; 76/4165, 1.8\%; 86/4160, 2.1\%; 104/4162, 2.5\%; and 119/4148, 2.9\%, for US \$0, \$10, \$20, \$50, and \$75, respectively; P{$<$}.001). In phase 2, the survey completion rate for the former US \$0 arm increased to 3\% (116/3928). Those originally offered US \$10, \$20, \$50, and \$75 who had not yet participated were less likely to participate compared with the former US \$0 arm (116/3928, 3\%; 90/3936, 2.3\%; 80/3902, 2.1\%; 88/3845, 2.3\%; and 74/3878, 1.9\%, for US \$0, \$10, \$20, \$50, and \$75, respectively; P=.03). For our secondary outcome of survey participation, a trend similar to that of survey completion was observed in phase 1 (55/4185, 1.3\%; 85/4165, 2\%; 96/4160, 2.3\%; 118/4162, 2.8\%; and 135/4148, 3.3\%, for US \$0, \$10, \$20, \$50, and \$75, respectively; P{$<$}.001) and phase 2 (116/3928, 3\%; 90/3936, 2.3\%; 80/3902, 2.1\%; 88/3845, 2.3\%; and 86/3845, 2.2\%, for US \$0, \$10, \$20, \$50, and \$75, respectively; P=.10). CONCLUSIONS: As expected, monetary incentives can boost physician survey participation and completion, with a positive correlation between the amount offered and participation.},

  abstract = {Surveys can be a useful tool for mental health services research. Unfortunately, clinicians typically show low response rates to surveys. To determine whether noncontingent incentives would increase responses among clinicians, we compared no incentive versus four incentives (mood magnet, \$1, \$2, \$5) on response to a 7-page self-report survey of mental health assessment and treatment practices in a sample of 500 clinicians from the 5 largest professional guilds. Noncontingent monetary incentives significantly increased response rate compared to no incentive across all disciplines. Noncontingent monetary incentives are discussed as a cost-effective method for increasing survey response rate among mental health clinicians.},

The number of contacts and the judged salience to the respondent were found to explain 51\% of the variance in final response. Government organization sponsorship, the type of population, the length of the questionnaire, questions concerning other individuals, the use of a special class of mail or telephone on the third contact, and the use of metered or franked mail on the outer envelope affected final response independent of contacts and salience. A causal model of the final response rate, including initial response, explaining 90\% of the variance, and a regression equation predicting final response rates are presented to show that high response rates are achievable by manipulating the costs of responding and the perceived importance of both the research and the individual response.]},

The established best practice of presending cash incentives is difficult to implement in Web surveys, and studies suggest that its presumed effects might not be witnessed in Web surveys. In contrast, several studies have found that lotteries can significantly increase Web survey response rates. Some authors have argued that this could reflect the fact that Internet users have come to expect Web surveys to be associated with lotteries. An experimental study among university students found that the lottery influences the Web survey response rates, but there are indications that different subgroups might be more influenced by this incentive than others. The observed differences are interpreted along the lines of possible differences in the degree to which different respondent groups expect incentives in return for their participation.},

When designing these surveys, one central concern is low statistical power, because respondents are typically recruited from a small and inaccessible population. However, much of what we know about how to incentivize elites to participate in surveys is based on anecdotal reflections, rather than systematic evidence on which incentives work best. In this article, we study the efficacy of three incentives in a preregistered experiment with World Bank staff. These incentives were the chance to win an Amazon voucher, a donation made to a relevant charity, and a promise to provide a detailed report on the findings. We find that no incentive outperformed the control group, and the monetary incentive decreased the number of respondents on average by one-third compared to the control group (from around 8\% to around 5\%).},

As part of a follow-up study of volunteers who provided a brief health history and blood sample for a blood specimen bank in 1989, the authors conducted a controlled trial of the effect of length, incentives, and follow-up techniques on response to a mailed questionnaire. Interventions tested included variations on length of the questionnaire, effect of a monetary incentive, and effect of a postcard reminder versus a letter accompanied by a second questionnaire. Response was similar for the short (16-item, 4-page) and long (76-item, 16-page) questionnaire groups. The monetary incentive did not improve the frequency of response. The second mailing of a questionnaire was significantly better than a postcard reminder in improving responses (23\% vs. 10\%). It is important to systematically test marketing principles to determine which techniques are effective in increasing response to mailed questionnaires for epidemiologic studies.

To better understand the state of the science, we first analyze response-rate information reported in 1014 surveys described in 703 articles from 17 journals from 2010 to 2020. Results showed a steady increase in average response rate from 48\% in 2005 to 53\% in 2010 to 56\% in 2015 and 68\% in 2020; a marked increase in the number of surveys per published article from 1.27 in 2015 to 1.79 in 2020; and that variables that predict response-rate fluctuations over time are related to research design (e.g. data-collection medium), participant motivation (e.g. incentives), and researcher motivation (i.e. number of surveys per article). Second, we propose complementary information on contemporary response-rate norms and benchmarks with a response-rate validity assessment framework to gather evidence on accuracy of inferences based on a particular response-rate level. Implementing this validation process involves gathering information on the researcher–participant relationship, participant qualifications and motivation, survey length and complexity, and cultural and national context. Future survey research should implement the validity assessment framework in addition to reporting the response-rate value to better indicate a sample’s quality, appropriateness, and representativeness.},

  abstract = {The effects of monetary gratuities on response rates to mail surveys have been considered in a number of studies. This meta-analysis examined: (1) the nature of the population surveyed; (2) the effects of gratuities in relation to the number of follow-ups; (3) whether the gratuity was equally effective across different populations; (4) whether the gratuity was promised or enclosed; and (5) the year of publication of the study. The bulk of the studies was done in the context of market research. Findings indicate that a monetary gratuity can be a powerful tool for decreasing non-response bias in mail surveys. Although follow-up mailings generally increased response rates in themselves, the gratuity typically had more impact than did an additional mailing. The gratuity was almost  equally effective for professional and general populations. Enclosing the gratuity was more effective than was promising it upon return of the questionnaire. The year of publication had some effect in that the impact of the gratuity was slightly greater in earlier studies. The additional expense of the gratuity to improve response rates appeared cost-effective for most purposes. These findings have clear implications for survey practice. When differences in response with and without gratuities were found, they tended to show greater response integrity in the gratuity-receiving group. (SLD)},

The average response rate increased 19\% when a gratuity was enclosed. When a gratuity was promised (contingent on the return of a questionnaire), the average increase was 7\%. Larger gratuities had a greater effect than lesser amounts—an enclosed \$1 gratuity increased the response rate by 20\%. This pattern was consistent regardless of the salience of the topic or the nature of the population (general vs. professional) surveyed. The impact of the gratuity remained substantial even when the survey design included two mailings—the use of follow-ups did not wash out the effect of the gratuity. The impact of the gratuity appeared to be attenuated by poor survey design and instrumentation, such as a cover letter that failed to present the incentive as a gratuity (rather than compensation). The findings indicate that the external validity of mail surveys can be substantially increased by the use of monetary gratuities.},

However, one aspect of incentivizing that has been understudied is its impact on participation bias, as different incentives may attract different subsets of the population to participate. In this paper, we present two empirical studies in the crowdworking context that show that the incentive offered influence who participates in the task. Using the Basic Human Values, we found that a lottery reward attracted participants who held stronger openness-to-change values while a charity reward attracted those with stronger self-transcendence orientation. Further, we found that participation self-selection resulted in differences in the task outcomes. Through attracting more self-directed individuals, the lottery reward resulted in more ideas generated in a brainstorming task. Design implications include utilizing rewards to target desired participants and using diverse incentives to improve participation diversity.},

In addition, promised incentives were much greater in value than are typically offered by surveys: \$50, \$100, or \$150 upon completion of the survey. The study analyzes the effect of variation in these incentives on unit response, including respondent-initiated phone calls to complete the survey, to an interviewer-administered survey about household finances. We find that prepaid incentives increased respondent-initiated phone interviews and the overall response rate and that \$100 and \$150 promised incentives both increased response rates relative to the \$50 incentive, thereby reducing interviewer effort.},

Discontinuation of the use of charity incentives should be seriously considered by future researchers. In contrast, the cash prize incentive yielded a significantly greater response than the control group, as expected, and was on par with the 25ø group. Additional investigation of the use of cash prize incentives is recommended.}

Specifically, we investigate the impact of empowering participants with the option to self-select between a piece rate payment method, rewarding each task completed, and an all-or-nothing payment method, which grants full payment only if all assigned tasks are finished. Data from two longitudinal studies shows that the self-select payment mechanism attracts more participants to sign up. Importantly, participants are willing to choose the all-or-nothing incentive when given a choice and subsequently achieve a higher rate of completing all tasks compared to those who are randomly assigned to a payment method. Nonetheless, the higher completion rate is accompanied by a trade-off: the quality of task completion diminishes when participants select the all-or-nothing scheme. Our findings suggest that offering the all-or-nothing incentive as an option can effectively achieve a higher rate of full completion provided that adequate quality control measures are in place.},

Yet there is remarkably little research on survey methods in education, or about the most cost-effective way to raise response rates among teachers and principals. In an effort to explore various methods for increasing survey response rates, we randomly assigned 1,177 high school principals in the state of Michigan to 1 of 4 experimental conditions. We varied the mode of survey delivery, the mode in which the prenotification letter was sent, and whether or not a \$10 incentive was provided. The results indicate that providing a monetary incentive substantially increased response rates over the no incentive condition and that principals were more likely to respond to a paper-based survey than a web-based one.},

Four mailings without an incentive produced a higher response rate than a single mailing with an incentive, but a combination of follow-up mailings and a \$1.00 or \$2.00 incentive produced a significantly higher response rate than an equivalent number of mailings without an incentive.There was some evidence of intertreatment response bias. Larger monetary incentives tended to produce: (1) a greater degree of effort expended in completing the questionnaires, as measured by the number of short answers and comments provided, and the number of words written, and (2) comments that were more favorable toward the survey sponsor.}

  abstract = {To investigate the effect of monetary incentive and the dose–response relationship of participants’ response rates in surveys.Three databases were searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that investigated the effect of monetary incentives on participants’ first and final response rates. First response is defined as the responses after the participant was initially contacted and final response is defined as the responses after several reminders were sent. The potential dose–response relationship of the amount of monetary incentive on the relative response rate (RRR) was established by fitting a restricted cubic spline function based on the robust-error meta-regression model.105 RCTs were identified. The first RRR increased by 49\% (RRR=1.49; 95\% CI 1.29 to 1.72) when monetary incentives were provided. Dose–response analysis revealed that an amount between US\$6.25 and US\$8 had the maximum effect on increasing the first response rate. On average, the final RRR increased almost by 20\% (RRR=1.18; 95\% CI 1.11 to 1.25) with monetary incentive compared to no-monetary incentive. An amount between US\$10 and US\$15 had the maximum effect on the final response rate, with an increase in the final RRR of 34\% (RRR=1.34; 95\% CI 1.19 to 1.51). There was a significant increase in the response rate when two or more reminders were sent.Monetary incentives and reminders improve the response rates. Future studies need to consider providing monetary incentives and sending at least two reminders to increase the response rate and reduce the chances of non-response bias.},

Theory suggested that both had high potential for success, but neither technique had been previously tested on a commercial population in the UK. Support was found for the monetary incentive but the booklet failed to induced higher response. Test of their impact on response quality, sample bias and willingness to be further interviewed showed that neither technique had any influence. The results suggest that a small monetary incentive can raise response rates to commercial mail surveys with no loss response quality nor distortion of sample composition.},

Design and subjects: A pilot study was performed in 1992 to test response rates to the QFFQ with three different distribution methods, with and without reward, in a random sample of 1200 adults aged 16–79\>y. In another study, the QFFQ was distributed to a nation-wide, representative random sample of 5008 adults aged 16–79\>y during June, September, November 1993 and March 1994. Reproducibility was evaluated among 90 responders to the survey who answered another QFFQ six weeks later. Results: The distribution method combining postal distribution and collecting the QFFQ by interviewer as well as an offer to participate in a lottery, gave the highest response rate (72\%). The possibility to get a reward increased the response rate by 9, 14 and 57\%, respectively, depending on the distribution method used. The mean daily energy intake and the percentage of subjects claiming to have unlikely low energy intake did not differ significantly between the different ways of distribution. In the main survey the mean ratio between energy intake and estimated basal metabolic rate was 1.58 among men and 1.47 among women, and 37\% of men and 45\% of women had a ratio below 1.35. Spearman rank correlations between the two QFFQ ranged from 0.48 (edible fats) to 0.91 (coffee) with a median coefficient of 0.70. For nutrients correlations ranged from 0.55 (carbohydrate E\%) to 0.81 (alcohol), with a median coefficient of 0.72. The season of questionnaire administration was of minor importance for the reported intake of the main foods and nutrients. Conclusions: The QFFQ-method is suitable for use in a Norwegian nutritional surveillance system.

Of the remaining questionnaires, 79\% were completed and returned after up to three mailings. The cumulative response was highest among cosmetologists who received a \$1 incentive with the first mailing, (81\%; 95\% confidence interval (CI), 80 to 82), intermediate among those who received \$1 with the second mailing (78\%, 95\% CI, 77 to 79), and lowest among cosmetologists who received no incentive (74\%; 95\% CI, 70 to 78). Characteristics of cosmetologists who responded after having received a \$1 incentive were similar to those who responded without having received an incentive. The higher costs per response incurred by the use of an incentive must be weighed against the benefit of higher response.},

  abstract = {The objective was to test two methods of reducing loss of data in follow-up by abbreviating the questionnaire and offering a token monetary incentive. Primary data were collected between September 14, 1998 and July 23, 1999 from an adult psychiatric population, representing about 50\% of all patients, all of whom agreed to participate in a quality-assurance monitoring program. Briefer components of the SF-36 Health Status Survey were expected to yield higher return rates than would the SF-36 plus a form assessing amount of treatment received. Small monetary incentives were expected to result in higher return rates also. Patients were randomly assigned to the groups (n = 73 each). Abbreviation of the questionnaire and use of a monetary incentive each reduced attrition by 10\%. A diminishing returns effect for both methods was observed. Further study of a possible interaction between the questionnaire's length and monetary incentive is recommended.},

We aimed to evaluate the effects of lottery incentive and length of questionnaire on health survey response rates when used in isolation or combined. A random sample of 440 residents in Western Sydney, Australia was randomly allocated to four equal groups to receive or not receive an instant lottery ticket and a long (seven page) or short (one page) questionnaire. The overall response rate was 71.8\%. The final response rates were higher among those receiving the short, rather than the long, questionnaire (75.6\% versus 68.2\%) (P = 0.08); and among those receiving the lottery incentive compared with those not receiving the incentive (75\% versus 68.2\%) (P = 0.09). By logistic regression analysis, the success of obtaining a completed questionnaire without any follow-up reminders was significantly associated with the lottery incentive but not the questionnaire length (P = 0.03 and P = 0.54, respectively). The difference between lottery and no lottery groups decreased gradually during the follow-up. A lottery incentive is associated with an increased response after the first mailing. A small up-front cost for a lottery ticket may be worthwhile, since it can save further costs by obviating the need for repeated follow-ups.},

  abstract = {Traditional survey research faces declining response rates due to changing cultural habits and technological developments. Researchers have developed novel approaches to increase respondents? likelihood of participating in web surveys. However, we lack information about whether these methods indeed increase response rates and, if so, whether they bias the resulting data. This article focuses on the use of nonmaterial incentives in the form of a video that provides the invitees with information tailored to their life situation. Analysis of our experimental data shows that instead of increasing respondents? probability of starting the survey, the video treatments actually decrease it. We provide evidence that the lower salience of the intrinsic benefits of survey participation in the invitation email significantly contributes to this reduction. Additionally, the effect of the nonmaterial incentive differs across subgroups, affecting nonresponse biases in line with employment status, gender, and migration background. We therefore conclude that using additional information in the form of a video as a nonmaterial survey incentive is only suitable under specific conditions.},

Research Design:~           Randomized controlled trial.

Conclusions:~           Among physicians caring for patients with lung cancer or colorectal cancer in northern California, a \$50 check incentive was much more effective than a \$20 check incentive at increasing response rates to a mailed survey. As physicians become increasingly burdened with surveys, larger incentives may be necessary to engage potential respondents and thus maximize response rates.},

There was a lack of evidence available relating to use of a monetary incentive to improve the response rate in the healthcare setting. METHODS: The MRC ORACLE Children Study is assessing the health and development of nearly 9000 seven year old children whose mothers' joined the MRC ORACLE Trial. We carried out a randomised controlled trial of inclusion of monetary incentive (five pound voucher redeemable at many high street stores) with the reminder questionnaire to parents. This trial took place between April 2002 and November 2003. When the parents were sent the reminder questionnaire about their child's health and development they were randomly assigned by concealed computer-generated allocation stratified by week of birthday to receive a five pound voucher or no incentive. The population were 722 non-responders to the initial mailing of a 12-page questionnaire. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Difference in response rate between the two groups. RESULTS: Inclusion of the voucher with the reminder questionnaire resulted in a 11.7\%(95\% CI 4.7\% to 18.6\%) improvement in the response rate between the two groups. CONCLUSION: This improvement in response rate and hence the validity and reliability of results obtained appears to be justified ethically and financially.},

This research analyzes the use of incentives coupled with introductory themes emphasizing cooperation and helpfulness—cooperative norms in American society—to understand their effects on survey response. This article analyzes two separate experiments (one phone and one mail) that provide evidence that norms of cooperation matter in the decision to participate in a survey, suggesting that this is particularly true at the refusal conversion stage. These results indicate that survey researchers may use such themes to their advantage, especially when conducting a nonresponse follow-up in a mail survey.},

Two online surveys with different incentives and contact modes were conducted. In study 1, both pre-paid cash incentives and a sweepstakes offering of equal monetary value were more effective than no incentive but the pre-paid incentive were more effective than the sweepstakes. In study 2, respondents who received a pre-paid cash incentive via postal mail after initially failing to respond to an emailed sweepstakes offer differed from the initial respondents with respect to demographic and psychological characteristics previously found to be important in a widely cited study of social networking. Therefore, non-response error may indeed be a problem in online surveys, at least among those directed to college students and using a common method of recruitment in which offers of sweepstakes drawings are delivered via email. Not only do the levels of variables important to an understanding of online communication vary by survey method, but also the lawful relationships among variables differ between groups recruited by different methods.},

First, follow-up mailings and monetary incentives should be used to maximize response rate. Second, given a limited budget for survey administration, follow-up mailings are preferred over monetary incentives. Third, if there is limited time for survey administration, monetary incentives may be preferred over follow-up mailings. Finally, follow-up mailings have the added benefit of enabling nonresponse bias estimation.},

  abstract = {Objective: Improving response rates, particularly among physicians, is important to minimize nonresponder bias and increase the effective sample size in epidemiologic research. We conducted a randomized trial to examine the impact of prepayment vs. postpayment incentives on response rates. Study Design and Setting: Self-completion postal questionnaires were mailed to 949 physicians who were respondents to an earlier survey and representative of the general physician population in Hong Kong. These physicians were randomly allocated to receive a HK\$20 cash prepayment incentive that accompanied the survey (n 474) or a postpayment reward of the same amount on receipt of the completed questionnaire (n 475). Results: The final prepayment response rate was 82.9\%, compared with 72.5\% in the postpayment arm (P .001). Of the eight alternative incentive and follow-up strategies evaluated, three lie on the efficiency frontier (i.e., not dominated), including postpayment with three mailings at HK\$42.7, prepayment with three mailings at HK\$66.5 and prepayment with three mailings and telephone follow-up at HK\$112.1 per responder recruited (US\$1 HK\$7.8). Conclusion: The findings demonstrate that prepayment cash incentives are superior to postpayment of the equivalent amount in improving response rates among a representative sample of Hong Kong physicians. Further research should concentrate on confirming the generalizability of these findings in other health care occupation groups and settings. 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

We conducted a randomized trial to examine the effects of cash and lottery incentives on response rates. A total of 4,850 subjects were randomized to one of three interventions accompanying a mailed survey-no incentive (n = 1,700), cash payment [three levels of Hong Kong dollars (HKD) \$10, \$20, and \$40; N = 50 in each subgroup], or entry into a lottery (three levels of HKD\$1,000, \$2,000, and \$4,000; N = 1,000 in each subgroup) on receipt of the completed questionnaire. The response rates were higher among those offered incentives than those without (19.8\% vs. 16.8\%, P =.012). Cash was the more effective incentive compared to lottery (27.3\% vs. 19.4\%, P =.017). Response also increased substantially between the first and second mailings (14.2\% vs. 18.8\%, P {$>$}.001). In addition, those with specialist qualifications were more willing to participate in mailed surveys. We found no significant differences in response outcomes among the various incentive arms. Cash reward at the \$20 level was the most cost-effective intervention, in terms of cost per responder. Further systematic examination of the effects of different incentive strategies in epidemiologic studies should be encouraged.},

Utilizing auxiliary information appended to an initial sample frame allows researchers both to drive differential or tailored treatments across the sample and to enrich back-end analyses, including a simple and efficient form of nonresponse assessment. In this study, we leverage variables appended to an address-based sample (ABS) design to (1) target different levels of incentives to some of the traditionally hardest-to-reach groups (e.g., younger adults, Blacks, and Hispanics) and (2) examine the potential for bias in the survey results by comparing respondents and nonrespondents across an array of key sample frame variables. Using data from a national ABS sample of 4,000 addresses, the study demonstrates that differential nonresponse is a problem with particular sets of addresses on the ABS frame (those with no telephone match), and although use of a mail survey combined with targeted incentives seems to reduce this effect, there is no single incentive structure-survey mode combination that works well across the three hardest-to-reach groups. The approach also allows researchers to assess the potential for nonresponse bias before determining if more extensive (and expensive) nonresponse follow-up methodologies need to be employed.},

  abstract = {Surveys were sent to 400 professionals in order to measure their propensities for financial risk and to obtain self-descriptions of personal and business financial risk-taking behavior. By modifying the type, amount, and risk of the incentive offered to each subject, 4 experimental treatments were created. There were 100 mailings per condition. The 4 conditions were: 1. prepaid, 2. promised, 3. lottery, and 4. a control group. A total of 175 responses were obtained -- 65 for the prepaid group, 33 for the promised group, 41 for the lottery group, and 36 for the control group. On the basis of statistical comparisons, the no-risk group response rate was substantially higher than each of the other incentive condition groups. No other significant variations among other conditions were found. A small, prepaid monetary incentive was much more effective in inducing a response than the risky monetary payoffs or no payoff incentive conditions. It does not appear that the kind of incentive results in a meaningful bias in the response pool.},

Households were randomly assigned to receive a debit card worth 20 USD or 40 USD, or no incentive. 20 USD and 40 USD both significantly improved conversion rates of prior noninterviews. Households in the high poverty stratum were more responsive to 20 USD than households in the low poverty stratum; race and marital status also interacted with incentive effects. Interviewers' notes for experimental cases were coded and analyzed to examine motivational influences on respondents' reactions to incentives. Results show that burden concerns expressed in a prior interview were associated with an announced intention to stop participating in the survey, which led to higher attrition subsequently. Incentive effects were no different for respondents who had complained about the survey's burden than those who had not.},

This mini-review reports the results of a structured review of the literature relating to increasing response rates for physician surveys, as well as our own experience from a survey of physicians as to their referral practices for suspected haematologic malignancy in the United States. PubMed and PsychINFO databases were used to identify methodological articles assessing factors that influence response rates for physician surveys; the results were tabulated and reviewed for trends. We also analysed the impact of a follow-up telephone call by a physician investigator to initial non-responders in our own mailed physician survey, comparing the characteristics of those who responded before vs after the call. The systematic review suggested that monetary incentives and paper (vs web or email) surveys increase response rates. In our own survey, follow-up telephone calls increased the response rate from 43.7\% to 70.5\%, with little discernible difference in the characteristics of early vs later responders. We conclude that in addition to monetary incentives and paper surveys, physician-to-physician follow-up telephone calls are an effective method to increase response rates in oncology-focused physician surveys.},

  abstract = {Background. The study objective is to evaluate the effect of monetary incentives on response rates of adolescents to a smoking-related survey as the first step toward participation in an intervention trial. Methods. A sample of 4,200 adolescent members of a managed care organization were randomized to one of four incentive groups: a \$2 cash group, a \$15 cash group, a \$200 prize drawing group, or a no-incentive group. We compared group-specific response rates and willingness to be contacted about future study activities, as well as costs. Results. Incentives increased survey response rates (55\% response without incentive vs a 69\% response with incentive), with response of 74\% in the \$15 cash group, 69\% in the token group, and 63\% with a prize incentive. Incentives did not adversely affect willingness of adolescents to be contacted about a smoking intervention, (65\% willing with incentives vs 60\% without, P = 0.03). In terms of cost per additional survey completed, token and prize groups were marginally more expensive than the no-incentive group (\$0.40 and \$1.42, respectively) while the large cash incentive was substantially more costly (\$11.37). Conclusions. Monetary incentives improve response rates to a mailed survey, without adverse impact on willingness to further participate in intervention activities. However, a variety of issues must be considered when using incentives for recruitment to intervention studies.},

Based on these advantages, two experiments were designed to increase response rates to the between wave contact mailing. The first experiment implemented a new protocol that increased the overall response rate by 7-10 percentage points compared to the protocol in place for decades on the PSID. This article provides results from the second experiment which examines the basic utility of the between-wave mailing, investigates how incentives affect article cooperation to the update request and field effort, and attempts to identify an optimal incentive amount.

  abstract = {Adaptive survey designs are increasingly used by survey practitioners to counteract ongoing declines in household survey response rates and manage rising fieldwork costs. This paper reports findings from an evaluation of an early-bird incentive (EBI) experiment targeting high-effort respondents who participate in the 2019 wave of the US Panel Study of Income Dynamics. We identified a subgroup of high-effort respondents at risk of nonresponse based on their prior wave fieldwork effort and randomized them to a treatment offering an extra time-delimited monetary incentive for completing their interview within the first month of data collection (treatment group; N\,=\,800) or the standard study incentive (control group; N\,=\,400). In recent waves, we have found that the costs of the protracted fieldwork needed to complete interviews with high-effort cases in the form of interviewer contact attempts plus an increased incentive near the close of data collection are extremely high. By incentivizing early participation and reducing the number of interviewer contact attempts and fieldwork days to complete the interview, our goal was to manage both nonresponse and survey costs. We found that the EBI treatment increased response rates and reduced fieldwork effort and costs compared to a control group. We review several key findings and limitations, discuss their implications, and identify the next steps for future research.},

  abstract = {Objectives Response rates for mail surveys of dentists and other health care providers have declined appreciably over the past several decades. The objective of this study was to update evidence about the impact use of incentives and different mail strategies on response rates in a mail survey of dentists. Methods We randomized private practice dentists in Iowa (N = 1267) into six study groups to test the effects of incentives and mail strategy on response rate. Survey incentives included either a \textbackslash 2 bill or a customized pen/stylus; a control group with no incentive was included. Mail strategies included bulk mail or first-class stamps. Results The overall survey response rate was 43\%. A \textbackslash 2 bill incentive was associated with significantly higher likelihood of returning a survey compared to the control group with no incentive (48\% response rate vs. 40\%, respectively). A non-monetary incentive was not significantly associated with likelihood of response. Use of first-class stamps compared to bulk mail did not significantly affect response rate. Conclusions This study demonstrated the effectiveness of a \$2 incentive to increase response rate in a mail survey of dentists. Given the background trend of declining survey participation rates, researchers should consider use of monetary incentives and explore new strategies to increase participation among dentists and other health care providers.},

  abstract = {Alms: To identify whether the form of introduction to a study and knowledge of a substantial prize influence the response rate of general practitioners (GPs) to a postal survey. Methods: A postal survey of 700 randomly selected Victorian GPs concerning management of early pregnancy bleeding and miscarriage, incorporating two randomised–controlled trials of recruitment methods; analysis of response rates and costs at 4 weeks and 11 weeks. Results: The response rate was 61.5\% of eligible participants. Doctors made aware of a prize were more likely to respond in the first four weeks (difference in response rate 10.2\%, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 2.8\%– 17.6\%). This difference diminished after the first four weeks. Doctors introduced to the survey by a telephone call were no more likely to respond than those introduced by a postcard. The use of a postcard saved 73\% of the cost of introducing the survey by telephone. Female doctors were more likely than males to reply (difference 12.3\%, 95\% CI 4.7\%– 19.9\%). Rural doctors were no more likely to reply than urban doctors. Very few doctors (16.2\%) completed a Practice Assessment activity associated with the survey. Conclusions: A valuable prize will accelerate response to a survey by GPs, thereby reducing the costs of follow–up. The cost of telephoned introductions is not justified, when compared with a brief written introduction.},

The effectiveness of four different procedures and three methods of delivery were tested for retrieving 20 page mail questionnaires delivered by face-to-face interviewers to a statewide area probability sample of households. Results indicate a significant difference in the rate of response obtained from those who were provided the post-incentive, the immediate follow-up or both, versus those who were provided no special treatment. The response rates also differed on the basis of delivery method. Upon controlling for delivery method, a difference due to the four experimental treatments was also found among those respondents who had questionnaires personally delivered to them. The overall response rates attained are too low to justify widespread use of the exact methods implemented here, but with slight improvements, for which research directions are identified, they may be improved to acceptable levels.},

It updates and augments the existing meta-analyses on incentives by analyzing the latest experimental research, focusing specifically on general-population household surveys, and includes the three major data-collection modes (mail, telephone, and in-person) under the same analytic framework. Using hierarchical regression modeling and literature from the past 21 years, the analysis finds a strong, nonlinear effect of incentives. Survey mode and incentive delivery timing (prepaid or promised) also play important roles in the effectiveness of incentives. Prepaid incentives offered in mail surveys had the largest per-dollar impact on response. Incentive timing appears to play an important role in the effectiveness of incentives offered in telephone surveys but not in-person surveys. Our model estimates a null effect of promised incentives in mail surveys; however, given the dearth of experiments testing this type of incentive, we are unable to draw firm conclusions regarding their effectiveness. Survey burden and survey year both were negatively correlated with response overall. However, neither significantly impacted the dose-response relationship. Survey sponsorship affected neither response rate nor incentive effectiveness. The development and results of the model are discussed, and dose-response estimates specific to mode and incentive timing are presented.},

The five methods we test are: 1) sending Web and mail modes of response sequentially; 2) providing a prepaid \$5 incentive; 3) offering an instruction card for responding over the Web; 4) sending the follow-up request by Priority Mail; and 5) providing an additional \$5 incentive with this follow-up request. Results are evaluated from the standpoint of response rates, demographic representativeness of respondents, and survey costs and data collection times for Web and mail modes. We find that a “Web-plus-mail” design—mailing an initial Web request followed by a mail request—with the prepaid incentive offers much potential for obtaining Internet responses. In addition, the mail follow-up to the initial Web request significantly increases overall response rates and improves respondent representativeness. However, the results also show that a mail-only design consistently obtains higher response rates and a demographically similar sample compared to Web-plus-mail. We also find significant challenges in obtaining a representative sample of respondents with either Web or mail modes and in realizing the potential cost and speed benefits of the Internet in using postal mail contacts.},

The current article presents the results of a web survey incentives experiment among almost 4,440 Ghanaian university students who were offered conditional and unconditional incentives of different values (in the form of telephone credit). Our analyses partly replicate Western findings: Higher value incentives produce higher participation rates and unconditional incentives outperform conditional ones in the lower value conditions. In the case of relatively high incentives, however, conditional outperforms unconditional incentives. No differential effects of incentives on response quality were found.},

Our goal was to determine the best ways to maximize Web response rates in a highly Internet-literate population with full Internet access. We find that providing a simultaneous choice of response modes does not improve response rates (compared to only providing a mail response option). However, offering the different response modes sequentially, in which Web is offered first and a mail follow-up option is used in the final contact, improves Web response rates and is overall equivalent to using only mail. We also show that utilizing a combination of both postal and email contacts and delivering a token cash incentive in advance are both useful methods for improving Web response rates. These experiments illustrate that although different implementation strategies are viable, the most effective strategy is the combined use of multiple responseinducing techniques.},

This research examines the effects of two manipulated variables, the appeal of the introductory letter and a nonmonetary incentive, on survey response rate. Gender was also used as an explanatory variable. Subjects were full-time professors. The instrument addressed faculty attitudes about the importance of scholarly activities. The nonmonetary incentive was a decaffeinated coffee bag. Cover letter appeal was more personal in the experimental letter than in the control letter. Of the 950 deliverable surveys, 422 subjects responded to the initial mailing, with 552 subjects eventually responding after 2 followup postcard  reminders. The hypothesis that nonmonetary incentives increase response rate was supported; incentives increased the initial response rate slightly, at 8.8\% for those receiving the coffee. There was no significant effect of the cover letter appeal or of gender. Benefits of the small increase in initial response must be weighed against the increased cost of conducting the survey.

We argue that online survey experiments have several features that make them robust to EDEs, and test for their presence in studies that involve over 12,000 participants and replicate five experimental designs touching on all empirical political science subfields. We randomly assign participants information about experimenter intent and show that providing this information does not alter the treatment effects in these experiments. Even financial incentives to respond in line with researcher expectations fail to consistently induce demand effects. Research participants exhibit a limited ability to adjust their behavior to align with researcher expectations, a finding with important implications for the design and interpretation of survey experiments.},

There is concern among researchers that some respondents will accept the prepayment but not complete the survey. There is little research to understand check cashing and survey completing behaviors among respondents who receive prepayment. Data from the International Tobacco Control Four-Country Study—a longitudinal survey of smokers in Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia—were used to examine the impact of prepayment (in the form of checks, approximately US\$10) on sample profile. Approximately 14 percent of respondents cashed their check, but did not complete the survey, while about 14 percent did not cash their checks, but completed the survey. Younger adults (Canada and United States), those of minority status (United States), and those who had been in the survey for only two waves or less (Canada and United States) were more likely to cash their checks and not complete the survey.},

Sampled physicians were randomly assigned to three prepaid cash incentive conditions (US\$2, US\$5, US\$10) compared to a control (US\$0). This study found using any incentive increased response versus no incentive. The US\$10 incentive produced the highest response and was significantly greater than the US\$2 incentive group. However, we did not find a statistical difference between the \$5 and US\$10 incentives or between the US\$2 and US\$5 incentives. In addition, any incentive amount increased the likelihood of early response compared to no incentive. This study builds on previously mixed results about the effects of various incentive amounts and effect on early survey response. These findings provide practical advice for researchers surveying physicians.},

This study consisted of four groups of randomly selected elderly married people (65–81~years) receiving a postal questionnaire measuring depression, social support, coping style, adult attachment, life satisfaction, and personality factors. All groups were exposed to a set of general initiatives (customized introduction letter with university letterhead; self-addressed, prepaid envelope included; personally directed letter signed by the researcher; an assurance of confidentiality). Three groups were exposed to different specific initiatives (short non-sensitive questionnaire, recorded response, and monetary incentive independent of response) to increase the response-rate. The results indicated that general initiatives and information letters apparently increased the response-rate from 10 to 31\%. Monetary incentive had the highest response-rate (51\%), good data quality, and no sampling bias in individual differences. This method can be highly recommended in future control group recruitment.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To investigate the impact on subject response of an information brochure and cash incentives included with mailed questionnaires in case-control studies. METHODS: A randomized trial was carried out within a case-control study investigating cancer in the Province of Ontario. Brochures were included with half of the mailed questionnaires sent to 7487 cases and 2561 controls. Controls were also sent cash incentives of \$2, \$5, or no money. RESULTS: With the brochure, response changed from 75.0\% to 75.8\% in cases, and from 70.3\% to 71.1\% in controls. Adjusting for differences in age, residence, sex, and cancer site/status, the change was 0.2\% [95\% confidence interval (CI) = −1.7–2.1] in cases, and 0.6\% (95\% CI = −3.1–4.3) in controls. The \$2 and \$5 incentives increased overall response in controls from 61.9\% to 72.8\% and 77.2\%, respectively, i.e., by 10.9\% (95\% CI = 6.1–15.6) and 15.1\% (95\% CI = 10.4–19.7), after adjustment. This effect was largely confined to urban areas (for \$2 and \$5, respectively: 5.5\% and 14.2\% in Toronto, 15.3\% and 20.4\% in other urban areas vs. 2.7\% and 1.0\% in rural areas; p = 0.02). Response time showed little or no improvement when the brochure was included, but was markedly reduced for both the \$2 and \$5 incentives. CONCLUSIONS: Cash incentives can improve subject response in epidemiologic studies, whereas information brochures do not appear to have an effect.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Achieving acceptable response rates from health care providers via postal questionnaires is an ongoing challenge. The use of monetary incentives is one of the most effective strategies for increasing response rates. However, the effect and cost of such an incentive on retail pharmacists' response rates has not been well studied. METHODS: A sample of 700 pharmacies was selected at random from the electronic Yellow Pages in NSW Australia and mailed a brief survey regarding pharmacotherapies and advice for smoking cessation. Half of the sample was randomly allocated to receive an offer of an 14 US dollars gift voucher. RESULTS: The response rates were 65.9\% for the voucher group and 53.5\% for the no-voucher group. The odds of response from the voucher group was 1.68 (95\%CI = 1.23, 2.30) times greater than for the no-voucher group. The cost per additional respondent was 67.95 US dollars. The incentive also reduced follow up costs by 10\%. CONCLUSIONS: A moderately sized monetary incentive is able to achieve a significant increase in response rates for retail pharmacists, thereby reducing potential bias in the sample.},

The effects of incentives are assessed with reference to (1) aggregate response rates and speed of response, (2) differential probabilities of response across demographic groups, (3) the apparent quality of the returned questionnaires, (4) representativeness of conditional expectations in the estimation of behavioral relationships, and (5) survey costs. The experiment contrasts prepaid first-wave, promised, and prepaid second-wave incentive treatments to a no-incentive control incentives, especially first-wave prepaid incentives, are found to increase aggregate response rates significantly, although the underrepresentation of some groups in the respondent sample may be exacerbated.

However, evidence on the response rate effect of donation incentives and especially altruistic and egotistic text appeal interventions is sparse and ambiguous. Via a randomized survey experiment among 6,162 members of an online survey panel, this article shows how low-cost incentives and cost-free text appeal interventions may affect the survey response rate in online panels. The experimental treatments comprise (a) a cash prize lottery incentive, (b) two donation incentives that promise a monetary donation to a good cause in return for survey response, (c) an egotistic text appeal, and (d) an altruistic text appeal. Relative to a control group, we find higher response rates among recipients of the egotistic text appeal and the lottery incentive. Donation incentives yield lower response rates.},

  abstract = {Insufficient response rates are a frequent problem in mailed epidemiologic health surveys. As part of a health survey of 1,235 young adults conducted from November 1992 through January 1993 in Geneva, Switzerland, a randomized factorial trial was carried out to assess the contributions of two tactics to increase response rates. The first incentive was the promise of sending 10 Swiss francs (7 US dollars) to respondents; the second was a red postcard, mailed 2 days after the questionnaire, which reminded potential participants to complete the questionnaire. The most effective strategy according to interim analysis was to be selected for follow-up mailings. Two weeks after the first mailing, response rates were 65\% for those who had received both incentives, 57\% for those who had been offered the money reward only, 54\% for recipients of the reminder card, and 48\% for those who had received neither incentive (p based on x2 (3 df) test\&lt;0.001). The relative hazards of responding were 1.34 (95\% confidence interval 1.15–1.55) for the money reward and 1.22 (95\% confidence interval 1.05–1.41) for the reminder card. Follow-up mailings to all nonrespondents included both incentives. At the end of data collection, 1,007 persons (82\%) had returned the questionnaire. The final response rates were 83,84,82, and 78\% in the four groups, respectively (p=0.29). Both the promise of a monetary reward and a reminder postcard considerably improved early response rates. The use of both incentives in follow-up mailings brought final response rates above 80\%, except for those who had received no initial incentive. Testing various combinations of incentives in the early stages of a mailed health survey may be a generally useful strategy.},

The results reported here are consistent with those found in the literature regarding the effect of incentives on response rates: they improved them, with prepaid incentives performing relatively better. We also found that state of residence was significantly correlated with choosing whether to respond to a survey. Regarding the effect of incentives on sample composition, we found that incentives tended to bias the sample in favor of less educated respondents, and tended to attract respondents less familiar with the survey subject. Finally, results indicate that incentives had very little effect on item nonresponse. Instead, item nonresponse was driven by education level, gender, and familiarity with the survey subject. However, combining the findings on sample composition with those of item nonresponse, it appears that the use of incentives indirectly affects item nonresponse by recruiting relatively more respondents that are less educated and/or less familiar with the survey topic, who are then less likely to respond to all questions.},

Most of this research has been based on surveys from the United States, whereas few studies have provided evidence that these results can be generalized to other contexts. This paper is the first to present comprehensive information concerning the effects of incentives on response rates and nonresponse bias across large-scale surveys in Germany. The context could be viewed as a critical test for incentive effects because Germany’s population is among the most survey-critical in the world, with very low response rates. Our results suggest positive incentive effects on response rates and patterns of effects that are similar to those in previous research: The effect increased with the monetary value of the incentive; cash incentives affected response propensity more strongly than lottery tickets do; and prepaid incentives could be more cost effective than conditional incentives. We found mixed results for the effects of incentives on nonresponse bias. Regarding large-scale panel surveys, we could not unequivocally confirm that incentives increased response rates in later panel waves.},

These two techniques have not previously been tested in mail surveys of commercial populations. However, evidence exists to support the hypothesis that the techniques which influence returns to mail surveys of general public populations may not necessarily do so in surveys of commercial populations. Thus, two essentially similar, yet separate, experiments were designed to determine whether a return deadline and/or a handwritten P. S. would increase response in a mail survey of commercial populations. The results of this investigation revealed that neither a handwritten postscript nor the addition of a return time limit significantly increased returns in two mail surveys of commercial populations. Further, no significant interactions were detected. To the extent that the results may be generalized, mail surveyors of commercial populations would be well advised not to waste scarce resources by relying on either of these two techniques to increase returns. Contrasting these results with earlier investigations supports the hypothesis that the response rates to mail surveys of commercial populations are not necessarily increased by the same methods that increase returns from the general public. In order to avoid wasted resources, surveyors of commercial populations should not assume that the techniques which increase response from the general public will necessarily do so among commercial populations.},

Three HMOs in the Cancer Research Network participated in a primary care clinician survey to better understand organizational characteristics affecting adoption and implementation of breast and cervical cancer screening guidelines. A four-stage data collection strategy was implemented to maximize response. This included careful attention to survey design and layout, extensive piloting, choice of token incentive, use of “local champions,” and denominator management. An overall response rate of 91\% was attained, ranging from83 to 100\% among the plans(N = 621). Although the response rate after the second stage of data collection met commonly used standards, the authors argue for the four-stage method due to the possibility of differences when comparing early and late responders.

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Web-based surveys save time and money. As electronic questionnaires have increased in popularity, telephone and mailed surveys have declined. With any survey, a response rate of 75\% or greater is critical for the validity of any study. We wanted to determine which survey method achieved the highest response among academic plastic surgeons. METHODS: All American Association of Plastic Surgeons members were surveyed regarding authorship issues. They were randomly assigned to receive the questionnaire through 1 of 4 methods: (A) emailed with a link to an online survey; (B) regular mail; (C) regular mail + \$1 bill, and (D) regular mail + \$5 bill. Two weeks after the initial mailing, the number of responses was collected, and nonresponders were contacted to remind them to participate. The study was closed after 10 weeks. Survey costs were calculated based on the actual cost of sending the initial survey, including stationary, printing, postage (groups B-D), labor, and cost of any financial incentives. Cost of reminders to nonresponders was calculated at \$5 per reminder, giving a total survey cost. RESULTS: Of 662 surveys sent, 54 were returned because of incorrect address/email, retirement, or death. Four hundred seventeen of the remaining 608 surveys were returned and analyzed. The response rate was lowest in the online group and highest in those mailed with a monetary incentive. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the convenience and low initial cost of web-based surveys, this generated the lowest response. We obtained statistically significant response rates (79\% and 84\%) only by using postal mail with monetary incentives and reminders. The inclusion of a \$1 bill represented the greatest value and cost-effective survey method, based on cost per response.},

  abstract = {In the past, incentive payments have proven successful in increasing survey response rates. In particular, incentives have been shown to increase the yield rate for harder-to-interview respondents. Despite this success, incentives are not without controversy. Opponents note that incentives may make the survey appear less important, destroy civic responsibility, and create an unnecessary expectation. Over time researchers may have to pay sizable incentives to achieve the response rates obtained 20 years ago before the use of incentives was common. Incentives could also have a detrimental impact on sample composition. The Alcohol and Drug Services Study (ADSS) included an incentive payment sub-study as part of its client follow-up phase. The sample for this sub-study randomized clients into four groups. One group was paid \$25, the amount received by other responding clients in the ADSS main study. Respondents in the other three groups were paid an alternative amount (i.e., \$0, \$10, or \$35). In examining the impact of varying incentives to sampling benchmarks, such as response rate and sample composition, the ADSS incentive sub-study found that the fears of opponents concerning the use of incentives were substantially unfounded, at least among the substance abuse treatment clients in the follow-up phase of ADSS.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Response rates to health-related surveys are declining. This study tested two strategies to improve the response rate to a health psychology survey mailed through English general practices: (1) sending a shortened questionnaire and (2) offering a monetary incentive to return a completed questionnaire. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. METHODS: Adults (n~=~4,241) aged 45-59~years, from four General Practices in South-East England, were mailed a survey on attitudes towards bowel cancer screening. Using a 2~×~4 factorial design, participants were randomized to receive a 'short' (four A4 pages) or a 'long' (seven A4 pages) questionnaire, and one of four monetary incentives to return a completed questionnaire - (1) no monetary incentive, (2) £2.50 shop voucher, (3) £5.00 shop voucher, and (4) inclusion in a £250 shop voucher prize draw. Age, gender, and area-level deprivation were obtained from the General Practices. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 41\% (n~=~1,589). Response to the 'short' questionnaire (42\%) was not significantly different from the 'long' questionnaire (40\%). The £2.50 incentive (43\%) significantly improved response rates in univariate analyses, and remained significant after controlling for age, gender, area-level deprivation, and questionnaire length. The £5.00 (42\%) and £250 prize draw (41\%) incentives had no significant impact on response rates compared to no incentive (38\%). CONCLUSIONS: A small monetary incentive (£2.50) may slightly increase response to a mailed health psychology survey. The length of the questionnaire (four pages vs. seven pages) did not influence response. Although frequently used, entry into a prize draw did not increase response. Achieving representative samples remains a challenge for health psychology. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject Response rates to mailed questionnaires continue to decline, threatening the representativeness of data. Prize draw incentives are frequently used but there is little evidence to support their efficacy. Research on interactions between incentives, questionnaire length, and demographics is lacking. What does this study add Contrary to previous findings, questionnaire length did not influence response rate. A £2.50 incentive increased response, while incentives of £5.00 and a £250 prize draw did not. Achieving representative samples to questionnaires remains a challenge for health psychology.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To test the effect of a AU dollars 2 scratch lottery ticket on response rates to a national mailed questionnaire of Australian general practitioners (GPs) and medical specialists. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was conducted and the incentive sent to half of the participants with the first mailing. A single follow-up mailing without incentive was sent to all non-respondents. Survey respondents were then informed of the research question regarding incentives and allowed to withdraw their study data. Differences in response rates between doctors receiving and not receiving the incentive, and between respondents and non-respondents, were examined. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 47\% (443 respondents). Twenty-two respondents (5\%) withdrew their data after being informed of the research question. Of the remaining 421 respondents, 233 had received the incentive (response rate 49.7\%) and 188 had not (40.1\%, p=0.0032). The absolute increase in response rate with the incentive (9.6\%, 95\%CI 3.2, 15.9) was quantitatively similar in effect to the reminder mailing (11.8\%). The incentive had a larger effect among the GP sample compared with specialists (13.4 vs. 5.9\%), although the difference was not statistically significant (p=0.20). There were no systematic differences in demographic characteristics between respondents and non-respondents. CONCLUSIONS: Increased response rates associated with a small incentive may reduce the need for a second mailed reminder, but strong views about the use of incentives may negatively influence the participation of some practitioners. While the overall response rate was low, there was no evidence of bias in our sample.},

  abstract = {Surveys are the most commonly utilized tool for collecting data from college students. In recent years, the increasing number of surveys administered to students has resulted in low response rates due to survey fatigue. The use of incentives, especially those of a lottery-based nature, has become a popular strategy for improving response rates. At present, however, there is little research on the effectiveness of incentives for surveys involving students. Thus, the purpose of this study was to investigate what types of incentives are most likely to be effective for boosting response rates among students in medical and health professions programs, and what odds of winning a prize are likely to be most effective given lottery-based scenarios. Results indicate two major findings. First, lottery-based incentives, including those that offer a prize of considerable value (e.g., \$250 cash and iPad) were reported to be much less attractive to students than guaranteed prizes, including those of relatively little value (e.g., \$5 gift card). Second, students reported they were highly motivated to participate if the topic was of interest, they knew their feedback would make a difference, be taken seriously, be sincerely appreciated by the researcher(s), and if the topic appealed to their sense of professional responsibility/civic duty.},

  abstract = {Experiments on incentives have a long history in survey research, particularly in mail surveys but increasingly in other modes too. Most of this work has focused on variations in incentive type, timing, and amount on response rates. There has been relatively little research examining the effect of different incentives on nonresponse error. Furthermore, most of the studies on incentives have been within a single mode. No studies, to our knowledge, have examined the effect of incentives in a study using more than one mode. This paper adds to the methodological literature on incentives in several ways. Although we compare a cash incentive vs. an in-kind incentive, which has been done several times, we examine these effects in both a face-to-face and mail survey. The cash incentive yielded higher response rates than the in-kind incentive in the mail survey. Furthermore, the in-kind incentive was related to one of the topics of a metropolitan area survey, permitting us to examine possible effects of the incentive on the composition of the resulting sample as an indicator of potential nonresponse error. Specifically, the in-kind incentive was a set of passes to regional parks, and the survey included a variety of questions on behavior and attitudes related to park use. We found that, although there were demographic differences between incentive groups, the response distributions on key related variables did not vary by incentive type.},

However, such knowledge about existing methods is not directly applicable to the Internet-based interviews. This study therefore examines the manner in which different combinations of incentives can affect response to a survey over the Internet. With such a purpose incentives have been chosen based on draws that has been administered under the pre-incentives philosophy (giving the possibility to participate in a draw, independently that the questionnaire was stuffed or not) or post-incentives (giving the possibility to participate in a draw only those that stuffed the questionnaire). A surprising result is that the joint use of pre-incentives and post-incentives slightly improves response rates, although it also causes rates to be considerably lower than when these incentives are used separately.}

  abstract = {An experiment was carried out to determine the optimal recruitment strategy for a new online household panel. The factors to be optimized were contact mode, incentive amount, timing of the incentive, content of the advance letter, and timing of the panel participation request. The experimental design took into account the “naturally” varying factor of whether or not the households involved had a known fixed landline. Contact was made by either telephone (CATI) or face-to-face (CAPI). The results showed equivalent contact and recruitment rates for CATI and CAPI for households with a known telephone number. The contact rate was substantially lower for households without a known telephone number, even when controlling for the effect of contact mode. The response rates were not affected by the content of the advance letter. Response rates were also independent of whether the nature of the panel study was explained before or after the recruitment interview was completed.All incentives were found to have much stronger effects on response rates when they were distributed with the advance letter (prepaid) than when they were paid later (promised). The highest response rate was found with a prepaid incentive of 10 euros. The 20-euro and 50-euro incentives did not substantially increase response rates beyond those seen at the 10-euro level. Moreover, in comparison to the 20-euro and 50-euro prepaid incentives and to the promised incentives, the estimated costs per registered household were lowest for the prepaid 10-euro incentive.},

  abstract = {Using incentives to reduce unit nonresponse in surveys is an established practice, with prepaid incentives being particularly effective in increasing participation rates. In this paper, we investigate how incentives affect participation rates and sample composition in an offline-recruited mixed-mode survey (concurrent paper/web and push-to-web), using an experimental design. We conducted a survey on residential satisfaction and reasons for moving place, sampling residents who moved away from two urban neighborhoods in Cologne, Germany, between 2018 and 2022. Addresses were provided by Cologne’s Office for Urban Development and Statistics, including information on the residents’ age and gender. Of a random sample of 3,000 persons, 2,000 received a postal invitation to participate in a web survey (push-to-web), while 1,000 received a printed questionnaire with prepaid return envelopes and the option to participate online (concurrent). In each group, 500 participants were randomly assigned a prepaid monetary incentive of a five-euro banknote. The cooperation rate with incentives was 50.6\%, and 26.6\% without; the overall cooperation rate was 34.8\%. Results show that incentives strongly increased the probability of participation, irrespective of gender and age. Within the sample, incentives enlarged the share of respondents with lower educational levels, lower incomes, and migration backgrounds, which can justify higher costs per response.},

Thus, important interactions among these three response-inducing techniques are found and discussed. Finally, it is concluded that these effects do not extend to response completeness.},

Previous work has demonstrated that paying subjects to complete questionnaires increases response rates, but this work has not well addressed the impact of the timing of incentives on total cost, cost effectiveness, and response bias. We surveyed 400 university employees about health benefits. By random allocation, half received a check for \$5 along with the mailed survey, and the other half received the promise of \$5 on return of a completed survey. The response rates for both groups were about the same (64 and 59\%, respectively), but prepayment was less expensive in aggregate and less expensive per response. In addition, we found that subjects with lower salaries were more likely to respond when paid in advance. We conclude that prepayment may actually be less expensive and more cost effective than payment on completion, but that the timing of payment may influence the profile of respondents.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of incentive size on response rates, data quality, and cost in a digestive health status mail survey of a community sample of health plan enrollees. DATA SOURCES/SETTING: The study population was selected from a database of enrollees in various health plans obligated to receive care at Park Nicollet Clinic-HealthSystem Minnesota, a large, multispecialty group in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and the nearby suburbs. STUDY DESIGN: A total of 1,800 HealthSystem Minnesota enrollees were randomly assigned to receive a survey with an incentive of \$5 or \$2. The response rates for each incentive level were determined. Data quality, as indicated by item nonresponse and scale scores, was measured. Total cost and cost per completed survey were calculated. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The response rate among enrollees receiving \$5 (74.3 percent) was significantly higher than among those receiving \$2 (67.4 percent); differences were more pronounced in the first wave of data collection. Data quality did not differ between the two incentive groups. The total cost per completed survey was higher in the \$5 condition than in the \$2 condition. CONCLUSIONS: A \$5 incentive resulted in a higher response rate among a community patient sample with one mailing than did a \$2 incentive. However, the response rates in the \$2 condition approached the level of the \$5 incentive, and costs were significantly lower when the full follow-up protocol was completed. Response rates were marginally increased by follow-up phone calls. The incentive level did not influence data quality. The results suggest if a survey budget is limited and a timeline is not critical, a \$2 incentive provides an affordable means of increasing participation.},

  abstract = {[Increasing use of incentive payments to survey respondents raises the threat of several unintended consequences, among them the creation of expectations for future payments and the possibility of a deterioration in the quality of response. Such deterioration may come about either as a direct result of substituting external for internal motivation, or as a consequence of expectations for rewards that go unmet by the survey organization. The findings from the present study are somewhat reassuring with respect to both of these unintended outcomes. Although people who have received a monetary incentive in the past are significantly more likely than those who have not to endorse the statement that "people should be paid for doing surveys like this," they are actually more likely to participate in a subsequent survey, in spite of receiving no further payments. And respondents who received an incentive 6 months earlier are no more likely than those who received no incentive to refuse to answer (or to answer "don't know" to) a series of 18 key questions on the survey. Furthermore, they are more likely than other respondents to express favorable attitudes toward the usefulness of "surveys like this." The generality of these findings, however, needs much further testing.]}

It is based on a systematic review of articles appearing since 2002 in major journals, supplemented by searches of the Proceedings of the American Statistical Association’s Section on Survey Methodology for unpublished papers. The article begins by drawing on responses to open-ended questions about why people are willing to participate in a hypothetical survey. It then lays out the theoretical justification for using monetary incentives and the conditions under which they are hypothesized to be particularly effective. Finally, it summarizes research on how incentives affect response rates in cross-sectional and longitudinal studies and, to the extent information is available, how they affect response quality, nonresponse error, and cost-effectiveness.

Many critical surveys use incentives to reduce refusals to participate, and the effects have been consistently documented to produce an increase in response rates. However, less is known about the effects of incentives on data quality or the long-term effects of using incentives on the public’s willingness to participate in surveys.

  abstract = {Background Questionnaires are valuable data collection instruments in public health research, and can serve to pre-screen respondents for suitability in future studies. Survey non-response leads to reduced effective sample sizes and can~decrease representativeness of the study population, so high response rates are needed to minimize the risk of bias. Here we present results on the success of different postal questionnaire strategies at effecting response, and the effectiveness of these strategies at recruiting participants for a field study on the effects of aircraft noise on sleep. Methods In total, we mailed 17 rounds of 240 questionnaires (total n\,=\,4080) to randomly selected households around Atlanta International Airport. Different mailing rounds were varied in the length of the questionnaire (11, 26 or 55 questions), survey incentive (gift card or \$2 cash), number of follow-up waves (0, 2 or 3), incentive for participating in a 5-night in-home sleep study (\$100, \$150 or \$200), and address personalization. Results We received completed questionnaires from 407 respondents (response rate 11.4\%). Personalizing the address, enclosing a \$2 cash incentive with the initial questionnaire mailing and repeated follow-up mailings were effective at increasing response rate. Despite the increased expense of these approaches in terms of each household mailed, the higher response rates meant that they were more cost-effective overall for obtaining an equivalent number of responses. Interest in participating in the field study decreased with age, but was unaffected by the mailing strategies or cash incentives for field study participation. The likelihood that a respondent would participate in the field study was unaffected by survey incentive, survey length, number of follow-up waves, field study incentive, age or sex. Conclusions Pre-issued cash incentives and sending follow-up waves could maximize the representativeness and numbers of people from which to recruit, and may be an effective strategy for improving recruitment into field studies.},

  abstract = {Background: The use of targeted advertisements on social media platforms (eg, Facebook and Instagram) has become increasingly popular for recruiting participants for online survey research. Many of these surveys offer monetary incentives for survey completion in the form of gift cards; however, little is known about whether the incentive amount impacts the cost, speed, and quality of data collection. Objective: This experiment addresses this gap in the literature by examining how different incentives in paid advertising campaigns on Instagram for completing a 10-minute online survey influence the response rate, recruitment advertising cost, data quality, and length of data collection. Methods: This experiment tested three incentive conditions using three Instagram campaigns that were each allocated a US \$1400 budget to spend over a maximum of 4 days; ads targeted users aged 15-24 years in three nonadjacent designated market areas of similar size to avoid overlapping audiences. Four ad creatives were designed for each campaign; all ads featured the same images and text, but the incentive amount varied: no incentive, US \$5 gift card, and US \$15 gift card. All ads had a clickable link that directed users to an eligibility screener and a 10-minute online survey, if eligible. Each campaign ran for either the full allotted time (4 days) or until there were 150 total survey completes, prior to data quality checks for fraud. Results: The US \$15 incentive condition resulted in the quickest and cheapest data collection, requiring 17 hours and ad spending of US \$338.64 to achieve 142 survey completes. The US \$5 condition took more than twice as long (39 hours) and cost US \$864.33 in ad spending to achieve 148 survey completes. The no-incentive condition ran for 60 hours, spending nearly the full budget (US \$1398.23), and achieved only 24 survey completes. The US \$15 and US \$5 incentive conditions had similar levels of fraudulent respondents, whereas the no-incentive condition had no fraudulent respondents. The completion rate for the US \$15 and US \$5 incentive conditions were 93.4\% (155/166) and 89.8\% (149/166), respectively, while the completion rate for the no-incentive condition was 43.6\% (24/55). Conclusions: Overall, we found that a higher incentive resulted in quicker data collection, less money spent on ads, and higher response rates, despite some fraudulent cases that had to be dropped from the sample. However, when considering the total incentive amounts in addition to the ad spending, a US \$5 incentive appeared to be the most cost-effective data collection option. Other costs associated with running a campaign for a longer period should also be considered. A longer experiment is warranted to determine whether fraud varies over time across conditions.},

  abstract = {Background: Low participation rates are one of the most serious disadvantages of Web-based studies. It is necessary to develop effective strategies to improve participation rates to obtain sufficient data. Objective: The objective of this trial was to investigate the effect of emphasizing the incentive in the subject line of the invitation email and the day of the week of sending the invitation email on the participation rate in a Web-based trial. Methods: We conducted a 2×2 factorial design randomized controlled trial. We contacted 2000 primary care physicians from members of the Japan Primary Care Association in January 2017 and randomly allocated them to 1 of 4 combinations of 2 subject lines (presence or absence of an emphasis on a lottery for an Amazon gift card worth 3000 yen or approximately US \$30) and 2 delivery days (sending the invitation email on Tuesday or Friday). The primary outcome was the response rate defined as the number of participants answering the first page of the questionnaire divided by the number of invitation emails delivered. All outcomes were collected between January 17, 2017, and February 8, 2017. Results: We analyzed data from 1943 out of 2000 participants after excluding those whose email addresses were invalid. The overall response rate was 6.3\% (123/1943). There was no significant difference in the response rates between the 2 groups regarding incentive in the subject line: the risk ratio was 1.12 (95\% CI 0.80 to 1.58) and the risk difference was 0.7\% (95\% CI –1.5\% to 2.9\%). Similarly, there was no significant difference in the response rates between the 2 groups regarding sending the email on Tuesday or Friday: the risk ratio was 0.98 (95\% CI 0.70 to 1.38) and the risk difference was –0.1\% (95\% CI –2.3\% to 2.1\%). Conclusions: Neither emphasizing the incentive in the subject line of the invitation email nor varying the day of the week the invitation email was sent led to a meaningful increase in response rates in a Web-based trial with primary care physicians.

In experiment 1, the group randomly assigned to receive a telephone call prenotification plus the lottery incentive responded 26-66\% more frequently than did controls (p = 0.02) after a single mailing. The postcard plus lottery was 17-54\% more effective than no intervention with controls (p = 0.05). A second mailing of the survey weakened these effects. In experiment 2, the group randomly assigned to receive a two-page survey with the lottery announcement responded 69\% more frequently after one mailing (p = 0.03) and 53\% more frequently after a second mailing (p = 0.04) than the group that received an eight-page survey without the lottery incentive. The shorter form alone or the lottery alone did not increase response rates significantly relative to the long form without a lottery. In experiment 3, a monetary incentive of \$5.00 contingent on response to the second mailing of the survey increased the rate of response from initial "nonresponders" by 100\% relative to control who received no incentive (p = 0.03) and 75\% over those who received \$1.00 not contingent on response (p = 0.04). Little sampling bias and no reactivity was attributable to the recruitment procedures.},

However, little is known about how decisions regarding the incentive scheme and the mode-choice design jointly affect key outcomes such as response rates, net sample composition, and survey costs. To study this, we drew a probability sample of the residential population of the city of Mannheim, Germany (N = 2,980) and randomly assigned target persons to one of four incentive schemes (€0, €1, or €2 prepaid incentive on first contact, and €2 delayed prepaid incentive) and one of two mode-choice designs (concurrent or sequential [web-push]). Our results indicate that small prepaid monetary incentives work better in concurrent than in sequential designs. Moreover, a €2 prepaid incentive in a concurrent design proved particularly successful for older target persons, probably reinforcing their sense of trust and reciprocity, while also fitting better with their survey-mode preferences. Finally, a €2 delayed prepaid incentive in a sequential design primarily motivated target persons aged under 50 years. This combination of incentive scheme and mode-choice design also proved to be most cost-effective in that age group. Based on our results, we recommend using sampling frame information on age to address different age groups with different combinations of incentive scheme and mode-choice design. This may help to maximize response rates, achieve a balanced net sample composition, and minimize survey costs.},

Of 2276 households sampled at the city block level, 934 were randomly assigned to receive a small one-time payment at the time of the survey, whereas the remaining households did not receive this incentive. We analyse the effects of incentives across a range of questions that are common in survey research in less developed countries. Our study suggests that incentives reduced unit non-response. Conditionally on participation, we also find little impact of incentives on a broad range of sociodemographic, behavioural and attitudinal questions. In contrast, we consistently find that households that received incentives reported substantially lower consumption and income levels and fewer assets. Given random assignment and very high response rates, the most plausible interpretation of this finding is that incentivizing respondents in this setting may increase their motivation to present themselves as more needy, whether to justify the current payment or to increase the chance of receiving resources in the future. Therefore, despite early indications that contingent incentives may raise response rates, the net effect on data quality must be carefully considered.},

The study uses a two-stage approach, starting with a preliminary survey to investigate participant attitudes toward different types of donations and an experiment, which added the least desirable £2 donation, from the preliminary survey, as alternative to a £2 Amazon voucher (the target) into the choice set. The study sample consisted of 431 university students. They were split into three groups: a control group with a standard £2 Amazon voucher incentive (216 participants), a decoy group with the target shown first (108 participants), and a decoy group with the decoy shown first (107 participants). We found significantly higher survey completion rates in the decoy group than in the control condition (82.3\% vs. 74.5\%). Notably, an order effect was observed – presenting the target before the decoy led to a higher completion rate (89.8\%) compared to presenting the decoy first (74.8\%). Importantly, the inclusion of the decoy incentive did not introduce any response bias. This study confirms previous studies on the decoy effect and enhances our understanding of how a decoy charity donation incentive can positively influence survey participation without negatively affecting response behaviour. It demonstrates the potential of such incentives to encourage participants to complete online surveys, even when a small monetary reward is offered.},

Methods An online survey was completed by 1500 men and women, aged 60 or above, from the general community in Japan. When responding to questions regarding motivation for participating in dementia prevention activities and providing support to people with dementia, respondents were randomly assigned different incentive conditions. Two incentive options were used for dementia prevention activities (no incentives, and a small number of reward points). Three incentive options were used for support activities (no incentives, a small cash reward, or an in-kind time reward that allowed respondents or their family members to use similar services at a later time (time credits)). Results Financial incentives decreased motivation for participating in dementia prevention activities, while time credits significantly increased motivation to participate in providing support to people with dementia for going out of their home, when receiving a cash reward was compared with receiving no reward. No significant differences by incentive were found for participating in daily living support for those with dementia or for providing support at a dementia café where people with dementia and their families interact. Conclusions The adverse influence of financial incentives on motivation to participate in dementia prevention suggested that financial incentives may reduce intrinsic motivation for dementia prevention activities. The positive effects of time credits in providing support to people with dementia in going out suggested that time credits might be effective for some support activities for people with dementia. Different incentive measures should be considered to raise awareness of dementia prevention and dementia support activities.},

  abstract = {Objectives: To evaluate whether small monetary incentives improve physicians' responses to surveys. To the best of the authors' knowledge, no one has evaluated emergency physicians' response rate and cost per participant of a small monetary incentive relative to a chance to win a more substantial sum. The authors compared emergency physicians' responses and per-participant costs between a \textbackslash 2 bill and a \textbackslash 250 lottery. Methods:Two groups of 288 emergency physicians were randomly selected and mailed a survey. Within each group of 288, half received a \textbackslash 2 bill and the other half received an offer that respondents would be entered into a drawing to win \textbackslash 250. Nonresponders received a reminder postcard one week later, and persistent nonresponders received a second mailing of the survey three weeks after the initial mailing. Results: Of the 576 surveys that were mailed, nine (2\%) subjects were ineligible or undeliverable, leaving 567 eligible subjects, of whom 301 (53\%) participated in the survey. The \textbackslash 2 bill had a substantially higher response rate: 170 (56\%) of those receiving a \textbackslash 2 bill participated versus 131 (44\%) of those receiving a chance to win \textbackslash 250 (95\% confidence interval = 5\% to 22\%; p {$<$} 0.001). The \textbackslash 2 bill offer was less expensive per participant than the \textbackslash 250 offer. The cost of postage and incentives was \textbackslash 997.33 for 170 participants, or \textbackslash 5.87 per participant, for the \textbackslash 2 bill and \textbackslash 979.29 for 131 participants, or \textbackslash 7.48 per participant, for the chance to win \textbackslash 250. Conclusions: Mailing a \textbackslash 2 bill incentive produces a better response rate with lower cost per participant than offering a chance to win \$250.},

A common method of increasing survey response is through the use of incentives; previous research has indicated the varying success of a variety of methods and levels of monetary incentives. However, there is less research on the success of non-monetary incentives. A common result is that non-monetary incentives increase response rates but they are generally less successful than monetary incentives. A less commonly studied phenomenon is whether incentives can induce biases in data by inadvertently drawing individuals from select population subgroups into the respondent pool or by influencing respondents’ item response behavior (Singer \&amp; Kulka, 2002).},

  abstract = {This paper outlines ways to maximize response rates to surveys by summarizing the most relevant literature to date and demonstrating how these techniques have resulted in consistently high rates of return in family practice research. We describe the methodology used in recent surveys of physicians conducted by the Centre for Studies in Family Medicine through its Thames Valley Family Practice Research Unit, located in London, Ontario, Canada and funded by the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care. The identification and implementation of these techniques to maximize response rates is critical, as primary health care researchers often rely on information gathered through questionnaires to study physicians' practice profiles, experiences and attitudes. Four separate and distinct mailed surveys of physicians using a modified Dillman approach were conducted from 2001 to 2004. The sampling strategies, topics, types of questions and response formats of these surveys varied. The first survey did not use any incentives or recorded delivery/registered mail and received a response rate of 48\%. In sharp contrast, the other three surveys obtained responses rates of 76\%, 74\%, 74\%, respectively, achieved through the use of gift certificates and recorded delivery/registered mail. Sending a survey by recorded delivery/registered mail tends to result in the survey package being given priority in the physicians' incoming mail at the practice. Gift certificates partially compensate physicians for time spent completing the survey and recognition of the time required is appreciated. The response rates achieved provide strong evidence to support the use of monetary incentives and recorded delivery/registered mail (along with the Dillman approach) in survey research. It is anticipated that this evidence will be used by other researchers to justify requests for funding to cover the costs associated with incentives and recorded delivery/registered mail. We recommend the use of these strategies to maximize response rates and improve the quality of this type of primary health care research.},

MATERIAL AND METHOD: The data were gathered during a nation-wide survey among all Norwegian general practitioners. RESULTS: There was a higher response rate among respondents who received non-conditional incentives. Although not significant at the 5 percent level, the effect is sufficiently strong to be characterised as interesting. INTERPRETATION: The results indicate that non-conditional incentives are effective in enhancing the response rate in surveys among GPs.},

  abstract = {The research reported is from a large-scale, national, mixed-mode survey (N = 49,675 addresses), in which token incremental, noncontingent incentives used in the second (mail) stage of the survey were tested in an experimental design. The levels of the incentives tested ranged from \$0 to \$10, in one-dollar increments, with the exception that there was no \$9 condition. Furthermore, the experiment was conducted using three types of household addresses that originally were sampled in the first stage of the mixed-mode survey via a random digit dial (RDD) frame: (1) households that agreed to participate in the mail stage of the survey; (2) households that were never contacted in the RDD stage despite numerous contact attempts; and (3) households that had refused to participate when contacted in the RDD stage. It was determined that among those households that had previously agreed to participate, even those that received no cash incentive (\$0) were more likely to return completed surveys than the groups of previously noncontacted and previously refusing households that received \$10. It was also found that the nature of the outcome of the prior contact with the household mediated (that is, interacted with) the proportional effects of the incremental incentives, in ways only partially consistent with Dillman’s social exchange theory. The findings, which are consistent with leverage-salience theory, suggest that if there is an optimal amount for an incentive to use in a mail survey, then it is a variable amount best targeted to the individual household.},

  abstract = {Background: Survey response rates among physicians are declining, and determining an appropriate level of compensation to motivate participation poses a major challenge. Objective: To estimate the effect of permitting intensive care physicians to select their preferred level of compensation for completing a short Web-based survey on physician (1) response rate, (2) survey completion rate, (3) time to response, and (4) time spent completing the survey. Methods: A total of 1850 US intensivists from an existing database were randomized to receive a survey invitation email with or without an Amazon.com incentive available to the first 100 respondents.  The incentive could be instantly redeemed for an amount chosen by the respondent, up to a maximum of US \$50. Results: The overall response rate was 35.90\% (630/1755).  Among the 35.4\% (111/314) of eligible participants choosing the incentive, 80.2\% (89/111) selected the maximum value.  Among intensivists offered an incentive, the response was 6.0\% higher (95\% CI 1.5-10.5, P=.01), survey completion was marginally greater (807/859, 94.0\% vs 892/991, 90.0\%; P=.06), and the median number of days to survey response was shorter (0.8, interquartile range [IQR] 0.2-14.4 vs 6.6, IQR 0.3-22.3; P=.001), with no difference in time spent completing the survey. Conclusions: Permitting intensive care physicians to determine compensation level for completing a short Web-based survey modestly increased response rate and substantially decreased response time without decreasing the time spent on survey completion.},

However, few studies have systematically investigated the use of monetary incentives or other methods to improve the response rates in the nonphysician clinician population. OBJECTIVE: To investigate differences in response rates to a mailed self-administered survey of nonphysician clinicians who were randomized to receive a prepaid monetary incentive, a postsurvey prize drawing, or no incentive. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial of financial incentives was conducted from November 2002 to February 2003. Nonphysician clinicians (nurse practitioners [NPs] and physician assistants [PAs]; N = 3,900) randomly selected to participate in a national ethics-related study were assigned randomly in equal allocations (n = 1,300 [650 NPs, 650 PAs]) to three incentive groups: (a) no incentive; (b) a \$5 prepaid token incentive in the initial mailing; or (c) a chance to win one of ten \$100 prize drawings upon completion and return of a self-administered survey. RESULTS: A \$5 cash incentive increased survey response rates to an adjusted 64.2\%: a 19.5 percentage point increase over the lottery group (44.7\% response rate), and a 22 percentage point increase over the control group (42.2\% response rate). DISCUSSION: A nominal cash incentive of \$5 yields a significantly higher response rate from nonphysician providers than receiving either a lottery option or no incentive.},

  abstract = {Background. Mail surveys of physicians have been characterized by lower response rates than general population surveys, raising concerns about nonresponse bias. Although monetary incentives have routinely been used to improve survey response among physicians, questions remain regarding how much of an incentive is most cost-effective. The present study seeks to further examine the effects of incentive size on response rates to a national mail survey of physicians. Methods. This study used a random sample of 873 physicians practicing in the United States; the response rate was 65\% (n = 563). Respondents were randomly assigned to receive a \$5, \$10, or \$20 cash incentive in the initial mailing. Except for the magnitude of the incentive, the procedures for each condition were identical, with each respondent receiving up to 3 follow-up mailings and 2 telephone calls. Results. Overall response rates ranged from 60.3\% for the \$5 incentive category to 68.0\% for the \$10 incentive category. Differences in overall response rates across the incentive categories, however, were not significant. Higher levels of incentives also did not significantly reduce the number of mail and/or telephone interventions required to reach the target response rate of 60.0\%. As expected, aggregate costs (excluding labor) were lowest for the \$5 incentive group. Conclusions. Our findings suggest that changes in the magnitude of incentive do not automatically result in increases in survey response among physicians. Possible reasons for this lack of effect as well as alternatives to monetary incentives are addressed.},

  abstract = {Surveys involving health care providers continue to be characterized by low and declining response rates (RRs), and researchers have utilized various strategies to increase survey participation. An important approach is to employ monetary incentives to improve survey response. Using a systematic review and analyses of 100 randomized comparisons (published in 48 papers) between monetary incentives and a non-incentive condition, this paper seeks to advance the understanding of best practices for using monetary incentives in clinician surveys. These analyses show even small incentives (≤\$2) to be effective in improving clinician response relative to non-incentive subgroups, with diminished returns associated with serial incremental increases above that amount up to amounts greater than \$25, at which point there is an appreciable improvement, supporting the use of higher incentives in this population. Cash and direct cash equivalents (e.g., cash cards and checks) produced greater odds of survey participation compared to vouchers, lotteries and charitable contributions, with lotteries and charities being the least effective forms of monetary incentive. Survey mode, timing and ethical considerations are also addressed. Noting the challenges associated with surveying clinicians, researchers must make every effort to improve access to this difficult-to-reach population by implementing appropriate incentive-based strategies designed to improve participation rates.},

  abstract = {The use of monetary and non-monetary incentives for increasing response is considered a proven and widely used method in surveys of individuals or households. This applies not only to mail, but also to face-to-face and telephone surveys. Experimental research shows that the technique is also effectively used in non-official surveys of organizational populations, not only to increase unit response rates but also to improve response completeness, response quality and speed and even attitude towards the survey sponsor, without negative influence on bias. Nevertheless the use of incentives is typically not applied in official business surveys. We report the meta-analysis of 34 experimental studies that implemented a monetary or non-monetary incentive in order to increase response rates in an establishment survey. The included studies comprise a variety of survey methods, sample frames, survey topics, research organizations, population types, industries, respondent types, countries, data types, and both voluntary and mandatory surveys. We report the mean effect size of the use of incentives and the mediating effects of the study features based on the metaanalytic method of inverse variance weighted regression using random effects maximum likelihood estimation.},

Dependent measures were response, retention, and item nonresponse. Mailed prenotification over no prenotification increased response and retention and decreased item nonresponse. Prenotification plus prepaid cash maximized response and retention. Item nonresponse was lowest with prenotification plus postpaid vouchers and second lowest with prenotification plus prepaid cash. In addition, we compared the cost for all experimental groups.

  abstract = {Survey researchers have carefully modified their data collection operations for various reasons, including the rising costs of data collection and the ongoing Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)~pandemic, both of which have made in-person interviewing difficult. For large national surveys that require household (HH) screening to determine survey eligibility, cost-efficient screening methods that do not include in-person visits need additional evaluation and testing. A new study, known as the American Family Health Study (AFHS), recently initiated data collection with a national probability sample, using a sequential mixed-mode mail/web protocol for push-to-web US HH screening (targeting persons aged 18–49 years). To better understand optimal approaches for this type of national screening effort, we embedded two randomized experiments in the AFHS data collection. The first tested the use of bilingual respondent materials where mailed invitations to the screener were sent in both English and Spanish to 50 percent of addresses with a high predicted likelihood of having a Spanish speaker and 10 percent of all other addresses. We found that the bilingual approach did not increase the response rate of high-likelihood Spanish-speaking addresses, but consistent with prior work, it increased the proportion of eligible Hispanic respondents identified among completed screeners, especially among addresses predicted to have a high likelihood of having Spanish speakers. The second tested a form of nonresponse follow-up, where a subsample of active sampled HHs that had not yet responded to the screening invitations was sent a priority mailing with a \$5 incentive, adding to the \$2 incentive provided for all sampled HHs in the initial screening invitation. We found this approach to be quite valuable for increasing the screening survey response rate.},

  abstract = {The effects on response rates to mail surveys of prepayment cash incentives, charitable donations, and the chance to win a lottery prize are examined in a true experimental design. A survey on environmental issues was conducted during the fall of 1994 among 3,088 households drawn from the Grand River watershed region of southwestern Ontario, Canada. The 20-cell incentives experiment crossed three levels of prepaid monetary cash incentive (\$2, \$5, and \$10) with a control group (no cash incentive), plus the offer to make a charitable donation ranging from \$2 to \$10 on behalf of the respondent, or participation in a lottery for prizes of \$200. The overall response rate to the survey, with three follow-ups, was 70.7 percent with the effects of the prepaid cash rewards demonstrated, but not those for the lottery or charitable donations. Logistic regression analysis of response rate supports a main effects model for cash incentives but does not support either of two alternative models for main effects of the lottery and charitable donations or interactions. Further analysis demonstrates a pattern of earlier response as a result of prepaid incentives. The findings are discussed in terms of their cost-benefit implications and with respect to conceptualizations of respondents' motives for completing mail questionnaires.},

A mail survey of ex-clients who had terminated treatment during the preceding year from one of six offices of a regional mental health center in the Rocky Mountain area strongly cross-validated these characteristics as well as other results from the consumer satisfaction literature. In addition, based upon evidence from marketing research, a randomly selected half of the ex-clients surveyed was offered a token inducement of two cents for returning the questionnaire while the other half was not. A significantly greater proportion of ex-clients who received the token inducement returned their questionnaires than did those who had not. This approach appears to be promising and further research with it is indicated.},

METHODS: As part of a survey of women's health conducted in Maryland in 2001, a randomized trial was performed to assess the effects of two incentives (US dollars 1.00 or a lottery ticket) as well as precontact with an introductory postcard on response rates. Questionnaires were mailed to 3000 women aged 40-60 who were randomized to one of six incentive/precontact groups: lottery/postcard, money/postcard, postcard only, lottery only, money only, or no incentive/no postcard. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 37.6\%. Each incentive/precontact group yielded a higher response rate than the no incentive/no postcard group, although only the response rates for the lottery/postcard group (41.3\%) and the money only group (40.0\%) were significantly higher than that of the no incentive/no postcard group (33.1\%). Money was the only factor that had a significant independent effect on likelihood of response (hazards ratio [HR] compared to no incentive = 1.22, 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 1.03, 1.43). Response rates were lower in minority ZIP codes, although the effects of the incentives were generally greater than in the nonminority ZIP codes. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that response rates to mailed women's health questionnaires may be improved with modest incentives, particularly cash incentives.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Survey researchers use monetary incentives as a strategy to motivate physicians' survey participation. Experiments from general population surveys demonstrate that prepaid incentives increase response rates and lower survey administration costs relative to postpaid incentives. Experiments comparing these two incentive strategies have rarely been attempted with physician samples. METHODS: A nationally representative sample of oncologists was recruited to participate in the National Survey of Precision Medicine in Cancer Treatment. To determine the optimal strategy for survey incentives, sample members were randomly assigned to receive a \$50 prepaid incentive check or a \$50 promised (postpaid) incentive check. Outcome measures for this incentives experiment include cooperation rates, speed of response, check-cashing behavior, and comparison of hypothetical costs for different incentive strategies. RESULTS: Cooperation rates were considerably higher for sample members in the prepaid condition (41\%) than in the postpaid condition (29\%). Similar differences in cooperation rates were seen for physicians when stratified by region, size of the physician's metropolitan statistical area, specialty, and gender by age. Survey responders in the prepaid condition responded earlier in the field period than those in the postpaid condition, thus requiring fewer contacts. In the prepaid group, 84\% of sample members who responded with a completed survey cashed the incentive check and only 6\% of nonresponders cashed the check. In the postpaid condition, 72\% of survey responders cashed the check; nonresponders were not given a check. The relatively higher cooperation rates and earlier response of the responders in the prepaid condition was associated with a 30\% cost savings for the prepaid condition compared to the postpaid incentive condition. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that the rewards of offering physicians a prepaid incentive check outweigh the possible risks of nonresponders cashing the check. The relative cost benefit of this strategy is likely to vary depending on the amount of the incentive relative to the costs of additional contact attempts to nonresponders.},

Results showed a statistically significant increase in response rates, mostly through reduction in refusal rates, in the half sample that received the incentive (a gift-type ballpoint pen) as compared with a no incentive control group. The effect appears to be due to greater cooperation from incentive recipients at the initial visit by an interviewer. Unexpectedly, the incentive group also showed a significantly higher rate of sample ineligibility, possibly due to easier identification of vacant residences or nonexistent addresses. In addition, evidence suggests greater response completeness among responding incentive recipients early in the interview, with no evidence of increased measurement error due to the incentive.}

  abstract = {Background: Nonresponse to questionnaires can affect the validity of surveys and introduce bias. Offering financial incentives can increase response rates to postal questionnaires, but the effect of financial incentives on response rates to online surveys is less clear. Objective: As part of a survey, we aimed to test whether knowledge of a financial incentive would increase the response rate to an online questionnaire. Methods: A randomized controlled trial of 485 UK-based principal investigators of publicly funded health services and population health research. Participants were contacted by email and invited to complete an online questionnaire via an embedded URL. Participants were randomly allocated to groups with either “knowledge of” or “no knowledge of” a financial incentive (£10 Amazon gift voucher) to be provided on completion of the survey. At the end of the study, gift vouchers were given to all participants who completed the questionnaire regardless of initial randomization status. Four reminder emails (sent from the same email address as the initial invitation) were sent out to nonrespondents at one, two, three, and four weeks; a fifth postal reminder was also undertaken. The primary outcome measure for the trial was the response rate one week after the second reminder. Response rate was also measured at the end of weeks one, two, three, four, and five, and after a postal reminder was sent. Results: In total, 243 (50\%) questionnaires were returned (232 completed, 11 in which participation was declined). One week after the second reminder, the response rate in the “knowledge” group was 27\% (66/244) versus 20\% (49/241) in the “no knowledge” group (\&\#967;21 = 3.0, P = .08). The odds ratio for responding among those with knowledge of an incentive was 1.45 (95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.95 - 2.21). At the third reminder, participants in the “no knowledge” group were informed about the incentive, ending the randomized element of the study. However we continued to follow up all participants, and from reminder three onwards, no significant differences were observed in the response rates of the two groups. Conclusions: Knowledge of a financial incentive did not significantly increase the response rate to an online questionnaire. Future surveys should consider including a randomized element to further test the utility of offering incentives of other types and amounts to participate in online questionnaires.

Our analyses showed the number of online surveys in published research grew steadily across the years. The average online survey response rate is 44.1\%. Our results indicate that sending an online survey to more participants did not generate a higher response rate. Instead, sending surveys to a clearly defined and refined population positively impacts the online survey response rate. In addition, pre-contacting potential participants, using other types of surveys in conjunction with online surveys, and using phone calls to remind participants about the online survey could also yield a higher response rate. The use of incentives did not show a significant impact on the response rate of online surveys. Other factors that impacted the rates included the funding status of a project, and the age and occupation of the participants. Concrete suggestions for reviewing and improving the online survey response rates are provided.},

  abstract = {Rationale, aims, and objectives High response rates to research questionnaires can help to ensure results are more representative of the population studied and provide increased statistical power, on which the study may have been predicated. Improving speed and quality of response can reduce costs. Method We conducted a randomized study within a trial (SWAT) to assess questionnaire response rates, reminders sent, and data completeness with unconditional compared with conditional monetary incentives. Eligible individuals were mailed a series of psychological questionnaires as a follow-up to a baseline host trial questionnaire. Half received a £5 gift voucher with questionnaires (unconditional), and half were promised the voucher after returning questionnaires (conditional). Results Of 1079 individuals, response rates to the first follow-up questionnaire were 94.2\% and 91.7\% in the unconditional and conditional monetary incentive groups, respectively (OR 1.78; 95\% CI, 0.85-3.72). There were significantly greater odds of returning repeat questionnaires in the unconditional group at 6 months (OR 2.97; 95\% CI, 1.01-8.71; .047) but not at 12 months (OR 1.12; 95\% CI, 0.44-2.85). Incentive condition had no impact at any time point on the proportion of sent questionnaires that needed reminders. Odds of incomplete questionnaires were significantly greater at 3 months in the unconditional compared with the conditional incentive group (OR 2.45; 95\% CI, 1.32-4.55; .004). Conclusions Unconditional monetary incentives can produce a transitory greater likelihood of mailed questionnaire response in a clinical trial participant group, consistent with the direction of effect in other settings. However, this could have been a chance finding. The use of multiple strategies to promote response may have created a ceiling effect. This strategy has potential to reduce administrative and postage costs, weighed against the cost of incentives used, but could risk compromising the completeness of data.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To compare the impact of unconditional and conditional financial incentives on response rates among Australian general practitioners invited by mail to participate in an online survey about cancer care and to investigate possible differential response bias between incentive groups. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Australian general practitioners were randomly allocated to unconditional incentive (book voucher mailed with letter of invitation), conditional incentive (book voucher mailed on completion of the online survey), or control (no incentive). Nonresponders were asked to complete a small subset of questions from the online survey. RESULTS: Among 3,334 eligible general practitioners, significantly higher response rates were achieved in the unconditional group (167 of 1,101, 15\%) compared with the conditional group (118 of 1,111, 11\%) (P~=~0.0014), and both were significantly higher than the control group (74 of 1,122, 7\%; both P~{$<~$}0.001). Although more positive opinions about cancer care were expressed by online responders compared with nonresponders, there was no evidence that the magnitude of difference varied by the incentive group. The incremental cost for each additional 1\% increase above the control group response rate was substantially higher for the unconditional incentive group compared with the conditional incentive group. CONCLUSION: Both unconditional and conditional financial incentives significantly increased response with no evidence of differential response bias. Although unconditional incentives had the largest effect, the conditional approach was more cost-effective.},

Conclusions were based on arithmetic combination of 497 response rates found in 93 journal articles. Response rates were found to be increased by personal and telephone (versus mail) surveys, either prepaid or promised incentives, nonmonetary premiums and rewards, and increasing amounts of monetary reward. Other facilitators that increased responding were preliminary notification, foot-in-the-door techniques, personalization, and followup letters. Several facilitators were found to be ineffective. An estimated magnitude of effect was calculated for each design variation.},

  abstract = {Cumulative evidence is mixed regarding the effect of lottery incentives on survey participation; little is known about why this strategy sometimes works and other times fails. We examined two factors that can influence the effectiveness of lottery incentives as suggested by leverage-salience theory: emphasis of survey attributes in invitations and characteristics of target populations. We conducted a web survey experiment where one condition highlighted lottery incentives in the e-mail invitations (incentive-centered condition) and the other highlighted the value of the survey with a brief mention of the lottery (survey-centered condition). We found that the incentive-centered condition had a significantly higher response rate than the survey-centered condition, especially among individuals with a relatively low income. Although invitation emphasis affected respondent compositions regarding motives for participation, the differences in response quality between the two experimental conditions were small and mostly not significant.}

  abstract = {Abstract             In push-to-web surveys that use postal mail to contact sampled cases, participation is contingent on the mail being opened and the survey invitations being delivered. The design of the mailings is crucial to the success of the survey. We address the question of how to design invitation mailings that can grab potential respondents’ attention and sway them to be interested in the survey in a short window of time. In the household screening stage of a national survey, the American Family Health Study, we experimentally tested three mailing design techniques for recruiting respondents: (1) a visible cash incentive in the initial mailing, (2) a second incentive for initial nonrespondents, and (3) use of Priority Mail in the nonresponse follow-up mailing. We evaluated the three techniques’ overall effects on response rates as well as how they differentially attracted respondents with different characteristics. We found that all three techniques were useful in increasing the screening response rates, but there was little evidence that they had differential effects on sample subgroups that could help to reduce nonresponse biases.},
